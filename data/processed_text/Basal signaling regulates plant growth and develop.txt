Abstract
The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (
PERK
) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50
PERK
genes in
Brassica napus
to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the
BnPERK
family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance.
Cis
-element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four
BnPERK
genes upon
Plasmodiophora brassicae
infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis
perk9
mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of
PERK9
in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role of
BnPERKs
in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.

1. Introduction
Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute the largest plant receptor family and are located on the cell surface to perceive and transduce a wide range of signals [
1
]. By initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction [
2
]. These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response [
3
]. For example, RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against pathogen invasion.
RLKs typically consist of three key domains: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain [
4
]. The extracellular domain, characterized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extracellular domain [
5
]. Interestingly, while some
PERKs
like
BnPERK1
and
AtPERK4
locate on the plasma membrane,
AtPERK13
has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall [
6
,
7
,
8
,
9
]. Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit kinase activity, which has been observed in
BnPERK1
and
AtPERK4
[
7
,
10
].
In
Arabidopsis thaliana
, the
PERK
gene family consists of 15 members, some of which show specific expression patterns in roots and floral organs [
11
]. However, some
AtPERK
genes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such as
AtPERK1,
which is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation of
PERKs
in response to different stress conditions [
5
]. For example, the expression of
TaPERKs
in wheat and
GhPERKs
in cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity [
12
,
13
]. In
A. thaliana
,
AtPERK13
has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role of
PERKs
in maintaining nutrient homeostasis and adaptation [
9
]. In rice, the
PERK
gene Z15 is activated by moderately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability of
PERKs
to diverse environmental cues [
14
]. Additionally,
PERKs
have been implicated in plant defense against pathogens. For example, the expression of
TaPERKs
is influenced by fungal pathogens, and
BnPERK1
has been shown to respond to the pathogen
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
[
7
,
12
,
15
]. In summary,
PERKs
are versatile players in response to various stresses.
PERKs
also play essential roles in plant hormone signaling. Several studies have highlighted the involvement of
PERKs
in the regulation of growth and development in response to hormonal signals [
10
,
13
,
16
]. For instance,
AtPERK4
has been implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during root cell elongation [
10
]. Furthermore, the expression profiles of
OsPERKs
and
GhPERKs
have shown differential expression patterns under different plant hormone treatments, including ABA, methyl jasmona (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxin [
13
,
16
]. The intricate regulation of
PERKs
by different plant hormones suggests their pivotal role in integrating hormonal signaling pathways to coordinate plant growth and stress responses.
In summary,
PERK
genes are known to be critical to plant growth, development, and stress responses. Despite the essential roles of
PERKs
in various processes across various plant species, comprehensive studies on the
PERK
gene family in
Brassica napus
(oilseed rape), an economically important crop serving as both an edible oil source and animal feed, are still limited [
17
]. This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors,
B. rapa
(AA = 20) and
B. oleracea
(CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago [
18
]. While a comprehensive study of
BrPERK
genes has been completed in male-sterile
B. rapa
plants, identifying 25
BrPERK
genes and exploring their potential role in male sterility, studies in
B. napus
remain scarce [
19
].
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive study of
BnPERK
genes to include the exploration of its evolutionary history, chromosome location, and gene structure through various computational approaches. Tissue-specific and hormone treatment gene expression patterns were examined using available transcriptome datasets. Additionally, the study also investigated the role of
BnPERKs
in response to the obligate pathogen
Plasmodiophora brassicae,
which causes clubroot disease in
Brassica
species. By providing insights into the molecular and functional roles of
BnPERKs
, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of this often-overlooked plant receptor subfamily and its potential applications in crop improvement.
2. Results
2.1. Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of BnPERKs in Brassica napus
Fifty
PERK
genes were identified within the
B. napus
‘ZS11’ genome (
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3
). Identification was accomplished through an extensive BLAST search using 15
AtPERK
sequences, revealing a higher number of
BnPERK
genes compared with those reported in
Arabidopsis
, Chinese cabbage, soybean, rice, sorghum, maize, cotton, and wheat (
Supplementary Table S4
). The BnPERK family of proteins exhibited varying lengths, ranging from 187 to 921 amino acids. Their molecular weights (MWs) spanned from 20.63 to 102.21 kDa, with BnPERK15C2 and BnPERK15A2 representing the extremes. Additionally, the isoelectric points (pIs) ranged from 5.26 to 8.59 (
Supplementary Table S5
). The data plots illustrated that BnPERK proteins exhibit a broad spectrum of MW and pI. Moreover, predictions of subcellular localization suggested that most BnPERK proteins were located on the plasma membrane and endomembrane system, while others were associated with the nucleus and chloroplast (
Supplementary Table S5
).
To investigate the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary relationships of the
PERK
gene family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (
Supplementary Table S6
). The
BnPERK
genes were categorized into four groups (I–IV) based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis. Group III, being the largest group, included 5 paralogs with 24
BnPERK
genes. Group I followed, containing 6 paralogs with 21
BnPERK
genes. Group II included 3 paralogs, with 3
BnPERK
genes, while Group IV contained only 1 paralog, with 3
BnPERK
genes (
Figure 1
). All
AtPERK
genes, with the exception of
AtPERK2
, exhibited a close syntenic association with the 50
BnPERK
genes. Most
AtPERK
genes corresponded to 2–6 orthologous genes in
B. napus
, each comprising orthologous genes from both the A and C subgenomes of
B. napus
. Notably,
AtPERK3
was associated with a single ortholog,
BnPERK03A1
, as its counterpart in the C subgenome appeared to have been lost. These results suggest that genome rearrangement and gene loss occurred during the polyploidization of
B. napus
.

PERK
gene family in
B. napus
and
A. thaliana
. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. A total of 15 paralogs were identified, grouped into 15 distinct clusters, each represented by a different color (PERK1 to PERK15). Based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis, the 15 paralogs were further categorized into four major groups, which are indicated by distinct colors (outer lane). Group I, light steel blue; Group II, cornflower blue; Group III, royal blue; Group IV, black.
2.2. Chromosomal Distribution and Collinearity Analysis of BnPERK Genes
The 50
BnPERK
genes were evenly distributed across the A and C subgenomes of
B. napus
, with 25 genes in each (
Figure 2
and
Supplementary Figure S1
). These genes were dispersed among all chromosomes, except for A10. The highest concentration of genes was on the chromosome A1, which harbored seven genes, followed by six genes on C6 and five genes on A7. Single
BnPERK
genes were identified on chromosomes A2, A3, A4, A5, C4, and C9. The results indicated an irregular arrangement of the
PERK
gene family across the rapeseed chromosomes (
Figure 2
).

genes. The locations of all the chromosomal
BnPERK
genes are shown in different chromosomes. The light green boxes stand for A subgenomes and dark green boxes stand for C subgenomes in
Brassica napus
. The light brown lines represent collinearity in
BnPERK
gene pairs.
The collinear gene pairs in the
B. napus
genome were analyzed to explore syntenic relationships among
BnPERKs
(
Figure 2
). We identified 81 collinear gene pairs, including 49 pairs resulting from segmental duplication between the A and C subgenomes and 32 pairs occurring within a subgenome. The result indicated a high conservation between the A and C subgenomes. Additionally, we assessed the selective pressure exerted on duplicated
BnPERK
genes by calculating the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) for the paralogous gene pairs (
Supplementary Table S7
). The Ka/Ks ratios ranged from 0.1409 to 0.2518 for 17 gene pairs in the A subgenome and from 0.1682 to 0.2519 for 15 gene pairs in the C subgenome. Furthermore, the Ka/Ks ratios for 49 gene pairs between the A and C subgenomes varied from 0.0482 to 0.5148. Notably, the Ka/Ks ratios for all paralogous gene pairs were found to be less than 1, indicating purifying selection acting on
BnPERK
genes.
2.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis of BnPERK Genes
To elucidate the functional characteristics of
BnPERKs
, the conserved motif, protein domain, and exon–intron organization were analyzed together with the phylogenetic tree (
Figure 3
). Ten conserved motifs were identified across the BnPERK proteins (
Figure 3
A and
Supplementary Figure S2
). These motifs exhibited consistent distribution patterns within the BnPERK proteins, with the exceptions of BnPERK15C2, BnPERK15A1, BnPERK15A3, and BnPERK10C1. Moreover, all
BnPERK
genes shared conserved tyrosine kinase domains, highlighting their functional significance (
Figure 3
B). Exon–intron analysis revealed structural diversity within the
BnPERK
gene family, though orthologous genes generally shared similar gene structures (
Figure 3
C). Most
BnPERK
genes harbored 5–9 introns, with the number of introns ranging from 3 (
BnPERK15C2
) to 16 (
BnPERK15A2
).

genes, with yellow boxes representing un-translated regions (UTRs) and orange boxes represented coding sequences (CDSs).
Cis
-elements analysis is crucial for understanding gene regulation and function. Accordingly, upstream 2 kb sequences from
BnPERKs
transcription start sites were analyzed (
Supplementary Tables S2 and S8
). The results revealed that 75% of the identified
cis
-elements were core promoter and enhancer region elements. The remaining
cis
-elements were associated with hormonal responses, various stresses, and developmental processes (
Figure 4
A and
Supplementary Figure S3
).
Cis
-elements regulated responses to diverse hormones, including methyl jasmona (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), auxin, ethylene (ET), and salicylic acid (SA), which were calculated (
Figure 4
B). The ABA and MeJA responsive elements were abundantly detected, and the auxin responsive elements were secondarily enriched (
Figure 4
B). These
cis
-elements relate to various biotic and abiotic stresses, such as light, anaerobic conditions, drought, low temperature, defense, and wounds (
Figure 4
C). Notably, there were light-responsive elements in all of the
BnPERK
genes (
Supplementary Figure S3
). In addition, there was a small part of the
cis
-elements that were categorized according to their roles in diverse developmental processes, including zein metabolism, endosperm expression, meristem expression, cell cycle regulation, and circadian control (
Figure 4
D). The presence of such diverse
cis
-elements suggests potential regulatory roles of
BnPERKs
in diverse biological processes.

genes. They were categorized into four groups (

), including hormonal responses (
B
), biotic and abiotic stress (
C
), developmental processes (
D
), and promoter and enhancer regions, which are represented by different colors and further categorized.
2.4. Expression Pattern of BnPERK Gene Family Across Various Tissues
The expression pattern of the
BnPERK
genes was analyzed across 14 tissues at various developmental stages through RNA-Seq analysis (
Figure 5
). The results exhibited diverse expression patterns across these tissues. There were 13 genes showing constitutive expression in multiple tissues, among which
BnPERK01A1
and
BnPERK01C1
exhibited the highest expression levels. In contrast, certain genes displayed specific expression patterns. For example,
BnPERK03A1
showed highly specific but relatively low expression in the sepal, and
BnPERK15A3
specifically expressed in the leaf and silique. Moreover, 18 orthologous genes of
AtPERK5
,
AtPERK6
,
AtPERK7
, and
AtPERK12
in
B. napus
were highly expressed in pollen.
BnPERK15C2
, which encoded the shortest protein, was not expressed in any tissues, suggesting a potential loss of function. These differential expression patterns of
BnPERK
genes point to their diverse roles in plant growth and development.
Figure 5.

gene family in various tissues of

BnPERK
genes across 14 different tissues, processed with log
2
normalization. The color gradient ranges from blue (indicating lower expression levels) to red (indicating higher expression levels), while the gray spots represent no detectable expression.
Furthermore, some paralogous gene pairs, such as
BnPERK01A1
/
BnPERK01C1
and
BnPERK09A1
/
BnPERK09C1
, showed similar expression patterns, being constitutively and highly expressed across all tested tissues. In contrast, other paralogous gene pairs, like
BnPERK06A1
/
BnPERK06A2
and
BnPERK06C1
/
BnPERK06C2
, showed specific high expression in floral organs. Additionally,
BnPERK15A4
/
BnPERK15C3
showed high expression levels in different tissues, except for pollen. However, some paralogous gene pairs exhibited distinct patterns, indicating functional divergence.
2.5. Expression Pattern of BnPERK Gene Family in Response to Hormone Treatments
In order to further explore the function of
BnPERK
s during hormone responses, we investigated their expression patterns in both leaves and roots after different hormone treatments (
Figure 6
). Among the 50 identified
BnPERK
genes, only a small subset was expressed in leaves and roots. Most of these expressed genes were strongly induced in leaves within 0.5 h after indole acetic acid (IAA), l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC), gibberellin acid (GA), trans-zeatin (TZ), or brassinolide (BL) treatments (
Figure 6
A). Additionally, four genes—
BnPERK15A4
,
BnPERK15C3
,
BnPERK08A1
, and
BnPERK08C1
—showed enhanced transcript levels at different time points after methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in leaves. In contrast, their expression patterns in roots were distinct. Most genes showed enhanced expression levels after GA and ABA treatments but decreased expression levels after MeJA treatment (
Figure 6
B). Notably,
BnPERK15A1
was strongly induced after MeJA treatment. Furthermore, three genes,
BnPERK09A1
,
BnPERK09C1
, and
BnPERK04C1
, which showed increased expression in leaves after IAA treatment, were also induced in roots.

Different dot colors represent different relative expression levels: red dot indicates up-regulated expression, blue dot indicates down-regulated expression, and the larger the dot, the greater the fold change.
2.6. Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis of BnPERK Genes
Predictive interaction networks were employed to explore the biological mechanisms of BnPERK proteins. The analysis revealed that the BnPERK proteins putatively interact with 1133 proteins in
B. napus
. The results showed that most PERK proteins serve as core nodes in these networks, interacting with various proteins participating in different biological processes (
Figure 7
A and
Supplementary Table S9
).

) KEGG enrichment analysis of proteins that interacted with BnPERK proteins. (
C
) GO enrichment analysis of proteins that interacted with BnPERK proteins.
KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the interacting proteins were primarily involved in processes such as pentose and glucuronate interconversions, plant–pathogen interaction, starch and sucrose metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, endoplasmic reticulum processing, and the MAPK signaling pathway (
Figure 7
B and
Supplementary Table S10
). Similarly, GO enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of terms like integral components of the membrane and plasma membrane in the cellular component category (
Figure 7
C and
Supplementary Table S11
). ATP binding and kinase activity were prominently enriched in the molecular function category. Biological process category terms such as protein phosphorylation, pectin catalytic activity, and cell wall modification were enriched. Protein interactions analysis provided a comprehensive view of the BnPERK proteins interaction network in
B. napus
, underscoring their central role and broad involvement in different biological processes, including sugar metabolism and plant–pathogen interaction.
2.7. Root Gall Formation and BnPERK Gene Expression in B. napus upon Plasmodiophora brassicae Inoculation
Galls were observed on the roots of
B. napus
at 28 days after inoculation with
P. brassicae
(
Figure 8
A). Cross-sections of the inoculated roots revealed the changes in the vascular system. Resting spores that stained blue formed in the diseased roots. Furthermore, diseased root cells exhibited hypertrophy and disorder, accompanied by thickened cell walls, while control roots grew normally (
Figure 8
B). To better understand the response of
BnPERK
genes to clubroot disease, we analyzed the expression of
BnPERK
at 14 days after
P. brassicae
inoculation by RNA-Seq (
Figure 8
C). Among the 50 identified
BnPERK
genes, 23 were expressed in either inoculated or control roots. Notably, four genes, namely
BnPERK09A1
,
BnPERK09C1
,
BnPERK14A1
, and
BnPERK06C2,
showed downregulated expression in response to
P. brassicae
, among which
BnPERK06C2
was completely inhibited after inoculation. Additionally, the paralogous gene pair
BnPERK09A1
/
BnPERK09C1
also exhibited consistent expression patterns across different tissues. These four downregulated
BnPERK
genes were implicated in the response to
P. brassicae
.

2.8. Function of AtPERK9 in Clubroot Disease
To explore the putative role of
BnPERK09A1
and
BnPERK09C1
in clubroot disease, the mutant of the orthologous gene
AtPERK9
(At1g68690) was used for clubroot disease investigation. Both the Col-0 and
perk9
showed disease symptoms on the main roots and the lateral roots (
Figure 9
A). The percentage of severely diseased plants (disease grade 3) in Col-0 was much higher than that in
perk9
, which resulted in a significantly higher disease index in Col-0 (
Figure 9
B,C). It indicated that
perk9
showed decreased severity of the clubroot disease.

PERK9.
3. Discussion
PERKs constitute a crucial subfamily of RLKs that play important roles in various molecular and cellular processes in plants, including development, signaling, and stress responses [
5
]. Despite their significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive study on the molecular functions of PERKs, particularly when compared with other RLKs. While genome-wide analyses of
PERK
genes have been conducted in some species [
11
,
12
,
13
,
16
,
19
], a thorough study of the
BnPERK
gene family has yet to be published. Therefore, this study systematically analyzed
BnPERK
genes, covering various aspects.
3.1. Deciphering the Evolutionary Dynamics of the BnPERK Genes
There were 50
PERK
genes identified in the rapeseed cultivar ‘ZS11’ genome, highlighting an increased number of
BnPERK
genes compared with previous studies (
Supplementary Table S3
). This expansion of
BnPERK
genes was attributed to the evolutionary path of the
Brassica
genus, which experienced a genome triplication following its divergence from the
Arabidopsis
lineage [
17
,
18
]. Through interspecific hybridization between
B. rapa
(AA) and
B. oleracea
(CC), the allotetraploid
B. napus
(AACC) arose. This complex evolutionary process contributed to the expansion of the
BnPERK
gene family. Studies have consistently demonstrated that whole-genome duplication and segmental duplications are crucial mechanisms driving gene duplication and the expansion of gene families [
20
,
21
,
22
]. The prevalence of paralogous gene pairs resulting from segmental duplication highlights the role of genome duplication events in this expansion.
Initially, it was expected that each
Arabidopsis
gene would have six homologs in
B. napus
due to two recent duplication events. However, only 50
BnPERK
genes were identified, suggesting a loss of duplicated
BnPERK
genes following
Brassica
genome triplication and hybridization. This indicated that gene loss was a crucial process during genomic arrangements and chromosome doubling [
23
]. This also implied a selective process, where functionally redundant
BnPERK
copies may have been lost, while the retained 50
BnPERK
genes may be crucial for plant development, hormone signaling, and stress response.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most
AtPERK
genes corresponded to 2–6 orthologous genes in
B. napus
, each of which included orthologs from both the A and C subgenomes. However, some
AtPERK
genes showed variations in the number of corresponding orthologous genes from the A and C subgenomes, suggesting extensive chromosomal rearrangements and asymmetric gene loss within duplicated genomic blocks [
17
]. Analysis of Ka/Ks ratios of paralogous gene pairs indicated purifying selection on duplicated
BnPERK
genes, implying their functional conservation and evolutionary constraint at these loci [
24
].
Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the
BnPERK
gene family not only enriches our knowledge of rapeseed genetics but also has broader implications for research in plant biology and stress-response mechanisms.
3.2. Exploring the Structural Diversity and Functional Roles of BnPERKs
The
BnPERK
gene family exhibited significant structural diversity, including variations in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points. These variations suggested potential functional specialization within the gene family [
25
].
Although functional studies of
BnPERKs
are limited, expression profiling can still provide valuable insights about the gene’s function and its role in different biological processes [
26
]. In accordance with the result in
A. thaliana
,
BnPERK
family members exhibited two distinct expression patterns: some were highly expressed in pollen, while others had broader expression patterns [
11
]. Constitutive expression of certain
BnPERK
genes indicated their essential roles in fundamental cellular functions, while some
BnPERKs
exhibited higher expression levels in floral organs, which is consistent with findings in other species like
A. thaliana
,
B. rapa
,
Triticum aestivum
, and
Oryza sativa
and indicates their importance in floral development [
11
,
12
,
16
,
19
]. Specifically, 18 orthologs of
AtPERK5
,
AtPERK6
,
AtPERK7,
and
AtPERK12
were notably expressed in pollen, among which
AtPERK5
and
AtPERK12
were shown to be essential for pollen tube growth [
11
,
27
]. Furthermore, certain
B. rapa
genes (orthologs of
AtPERK6
and
AtPERK12
) were associated with male sterility, as they were downregulated in male-sterile mutants [
19
].
BnPERK01A1
and
BnPERK01C1
(orthologs of
AtPERK1
) showed constitutively high expression, suggesting essential roles in fundamental cellular functions. Functional analysis of
BnPERK1
indicated its role in regulating cell wall integrity, signaling in stress responses, and facilitating growth and development in
Arabidopsis
[
15
].
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the
BnPERK
genes originated through segmental duplication [
28
]. Structural examination confirmed the phylogenetic arrangement, with most
BnPERK
genes sharing conserved motifs and tyrosine kinase domains. Differences in gene structure and
cis
-acting regulatory elements in promoters suggested evolutionary divergence, which may contribute to functional diversity and evolutionary mechanisms [
29
]. Analysis of the
cis
-element indicated that
BnPERK
genes were responsive to various stresses and hormone signaling pathways, with MeJA- and ABA-responsive elements being particularly abundant. This suggests that
BnPERK
genes could mediate diverse gene expression patterns and provide flexibility in stress responses [
30
].
Further study on the expression patterns of
BnPERK
genes in response to hormone treatments provided insights into their potential roles in hormone signaling and plant development. This rapid and robust response to IAA, ET, GA, CK, and BL suggested that
BnPERK
genes might play a crucial role in the early stages of hormonal signal transduction in leaves, possibly by mediating the downstream effects of these hormones. In contrast, the expression profiles in roots exhibited totally different expression patterns, which highlights the complexity and specificity of hormonal regulation in different tissues. Enhanced expression levels after GA and ABA treatments in roots suggest involvements in root growth and stress adaptation [
31
,
32
]. The contrasting expression patterns after MeJA treatment in roots and leaves imply distinct roles in different tissues. Additionally, the observation that genes such as
BnPERK09A1
,
BnPERK09C1
, and
BnPERK04C1
were induced in both leaves and roots after IAA treatment implies a role in auxin signaling, which is central to various developmental processes, including cell elongation and differentiation [
33
]. These genes may act as intermediaries in auxin signal transduction pathways, influencing growth and development in a tissue-specific manner.
In summary, the comprehensive examination illuminates the structural diversity and functional implications of the
BnPERK
gene family. The differential expression patterns of
BnPERK
genes in response to various hormone treatments highlight their potential involvement in diverse physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and defense mechanisms.
3.3. Revealing the Role of BnPERK in Clubroot Disease
Recent studies have suggested that receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including PERKs are involved in plant–pathogen interactions and immune responses [
2
,
3
,
4
]. Analysis of
cis
-elements and expression profiles suggested that
BnPERKs
may act as novel sensors for various stresses, particularly plant pathogen infections [
5
,
12
]. Protein–protein interaction network analysis supported this result, revealing the multifunctionality of BnPERK proteins and emphasizing their broad participation in plant physiological processes specific to plant disease response [
34
]. The interactions involved cell wall organization, plant–pathogen interactions, plasma membrane dynamics, endomembrane activities, MAPK signaling pathways, and starch/sucrose metabolism. Given that pathogen-induced changes in cell walls affected disease resistance, it is possible that
BnPERKs
detect these alterations and initiate responses to maintain cell wall integrity [
35
]. The membrane localization of
BnPERKs
suggested they might perceive infection signals at the cell’s surface. Upon activation by cell wall components,
BnPERKs
likely trigger downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways [
36
]. Otherwise, MAPK pathways also acted as downstream signaling components of hormones and played important roles in plant responses to different stresses [
37
]. Despite these insights, the exact role of
BnPERKs
in plant immunity remains largely unknown, and their interactions with RLKs or coreceptors remain largely unexplored.
Clubroot disease, caused by the obligate parasite
P. brassicae
, poses a significant threat to Brassicaceae plants [
38
]. The parasite is dependent on plant-derived sugars as a carbon source for colonization [
39
,
40
]. The enriched sugar metabolism reflects the altered homeostasis and increased demand for sugar in infected plants. However, the downstream signaling components and their regulation in response to
P. brassicae
infection are not yet clear. The
PERK
gene family, with its known functions in cell wall integrity and stress responses, may contribute to reinforcing the plant cell wall during pathogen infection or modulating defense-related signaling pathways [
5
]. Given the role of
PERKs
in disease response, the involvement of the
PERK
gene family in
B. napus
in clubroot disease was as expected. The transcriptional downregulation of
BnPERK09A1
,
BnPERK09C1
,
BnPERK14A1
, and
BnPERK06C2
upon
P. brassicae
infection suggests their putative roles in clubroot disease response. In accordance with the result in
B. napus
, the expression of
AtPERK9
was also downregulated in response to
P. brassicae
. The
perk9
mutant was used for clubroot disease investigation, indicating the roles of
BnPERK09A1
and
BnPERK09C1
in the disease resistance. Pathogenesis-related proteins including enzymes like β-1,3-glucanase (PR2) and thionins (PR5), which have antimicrobial activity and are involved in the basal immune response [
41
]. The
RBOHD
(Respiratory burst oxidase homolog D) gene is crucial in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of the plant immune system [
42
]. The increased expression of these genes suggested that the knockout of
AtPERK9
triggered the basal immune response, resulting in increased disease resistance in
perk9.
The induction of
PR2
and
RBOHD
in both Col-0 and
perk9
after inoculation suggested that basal immune response occurred in susceptible Col-0. Furthermore, the induction of
BnPERK09A1
and
BnPERK09C1
by IAA treatment was also particularly intriguing, as IAA is known to act as a signaling molecule potentially involved in the response to
P. brassicae
infection [
43
,
44
,
45
]. However, the exact roles of
BnPERK09A1
and
BnPERK09C1
need further function study. The predicted interaction proteins associated with these pathways implied their roles in mediating the interaction between
B. napus
and
P. brassicae
, providing targets for further functional characterization.
In summary, uncovering the role of
BnPERKs
in clubroot disease response provided valuable insights into plant–pathogen interactions and potential strategies for disease management.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Identification of BnPERK Genes in Brassica napus
The
BnPERK
gene family was selected in this study due to its critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses. It has not been extensively studied in
B. napus
, making it a valuable target for genome-wide analysis. The genomic data and annotation for the
B. napus
cultivar ‘ZS11’ were sourced from
B. napus
multi-omics information resource (BnIR) (
https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/BnIR
, accessed on 1 March 2024) [
46
]. The
PERK
genes in
B. napus
were identified using BLASTp (
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
) with an E-value threshold of 10
−5
, employing the protein sequence of 15 AtPERKs as queries [
11
]. The
BnPERK
gene family members were named based on their orthologous relationships and chromosomal location. By searching the conserved domain in InterPro (
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro
, accessed on 5 March 2024) and the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi
, accessed on 5 March 2024), the tyrosine kinase domain-containing protein sequences were verified for candidate
BnPERK
genes. Additionally, Expasy (
https://web.expasy.org/protparam
, accessed on 8 March 2024) was utilized to assess the isoelectric points (pIs) and the molecular weights (MWs) of BnPERK proteins. Subcellular locations of these proteins were predicted using Euk-mPLoc [
47
] (
http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2
, accessed on8 March 2024).
4.2. Chromosomal Location, Gene Duplication, and Phylogenetic Analysis
The positions of the
BnPERK
genes on the chromosomes were obtained from the annotation of the
B. napus
genome. McScanX (
https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/software/mcscanx
) was employed to detect the duplication patterns, including segmental and tandem duplication [
48
]. Visualization of chromosomal distribution and duplication events was represented using Circos (Vers. 0.69-9) software [
49
]. The Ka/Ks (nonsynonymous substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate) ratio was calculated for the paralogous gene pairs using ParaAT2.0 [
50
]. Collinearity analysis of
BnPERK
genes was conducted and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [
51
]. A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 11 [
52
] through neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications and visualized using iTol (
https://itol.embl.de
, accessed on 11 March 2024).
4.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis
The exon–intron structure of
PERK
genes was examined using Gene Structure Display Server 2.0 (
https://gsds.gao-lab.org/index.php/
accessed on 14 March 2024). Conserved motifs were predicted using Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (
https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme
, accessed on 14 March 2024). The sequences of 2 Kb upstream from the start codon of 50
BnPERK
genes were extracted from the
B. napus
‘ZS11’ genome and analyzed for
cis
-elements using PlantCARE [
53
] (
http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html
, accessed on 14 March 2024) to predict
cis
-elements. The data were visualized using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [
51
].
4.4. Expression Profiles of BnPERK Genes in Different Tissues and Under Hormone Treatments
To display different expression profiles, RNA-Seq data from various tissues and the hormone response of
B. napus
cultivar ‘ZS11’ were obtained from BnIR. A total of 14 tissues at different development stages included seed, leaf, bud, root, petal, sepal, pollen, silique, filament, cotyledon, lower stem peel, middle stem peel, upper stem peel, and vegetative rosette stages. The roots and leaves were treated with hormones (IAA, auxin; ACC, l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid; GA, gibberellin acid; ABA, abscisic acid; TZ, trans-zeatin; JA, methyl jasmonate; BL, brassinolide) and sampled at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h after treatment. Heatmaps were generated using these expression values after logarithmic transformed RPKM values and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [
51
].
4.5. Network-Based Prediction of Protein Interactions
Analysis of the protein–protein interaction network in
B. napus
was predicted using STRING (
https://cn.string-db.org/
, accessed on 15 March 2024), and the interactions were displayed using Cytoscape (Vers. 3.9.1) [
54
]. In order to investigate the biological process involving
B. napus
genes, the putative interacted genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted by BnaOmics [
55
] (
https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/tools/enrich/
, accessed on 15 March 2024).
4.6. Plasmodiophora Brassicae Inoculation, Clubroot Disease Investigation, and Histocytological Analysis
A collection of
Plasmodiophora brassicae
isolate from Zhijiang, Hubei, was used for inoculation in greenhouse. The seeds of
B. napus
cultivar ‘ZS11’, wild-type
A. thaliana
(Col-0), and
AtPERK9
mutant were germinated in a greenhouse maintained at 24 °C under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod. Seven-day-old rapeseed seedlings were inoculated with resting spores of
P. brassicae
at a concentration of 10
−6
spores/mL [
56
]. Two-week-old
Arabidopsis
seedlings were inoculated at a concentration of 10
−5
spores/mL. The clubroot disease was investigated and photographed at 28–35 days after inoculation. The disease index was assessed using the following 0–3 scoring system: 0 refers to healthy roots; 1 refers to small galls on lateral roots only; 2 refers to small and medium galls covering the main root and a few lateral roots; 3 indicates large galls on the main root. The disease index (DI) was calculated according to the following formula: DI = 100 × (1 × N
1
+ 2 × N
2
+ 3 × N
3
)/3 × N
t
. N
1
to N
3
refer to the number of plants in the indicated class, and N
t
is the total number of plants tested.
The progression of cortex infection by
P. brassicae
was studied. Approximately 0.5 cm long root segments were excised from the upper of the primary root. Following standard protocols for fixation and dehydration, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5–8 μM. Sections were analyzed and photographed using an optical microscope.
4.7. Transcriptome Analysis of BnPERK Genes in B. napus During Clubroot Disease
Root samples of
B. napus
infected with
P. brassicae
and uninfected controls were harvested at 14 days after treatment for RNA-Seq analysis. After sequencing and quality control, bioinformatics pipelines were using to clean raw sequencing data by removing adapters and low-quality reads. Then, the clean reads were aligned to the genome of ‘ZS11’. Gene expression levels were estimated using logarithmic transformed FPKM values. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and control samples were determined with the DEGseq2 (adjusted
p
< 0.05 and |log
2
(fold-change)| ≥ 1) and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056).
4.8. qRT-PCR Analysis of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) Genes in A. thaliana
Root samples from
Arabidopsis
Col-0 and
perk9
infected with
P. brassicae
and uninfected controls were harvested at 14 days after inoculation for qRT-PCR study. Total RNA was extracted from control and inoculated roots using the FastPure Universal Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with HiScript IV RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme). Gene-specific primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S1
.
Actin2
was used as reference gene. After running the qRT-PCR reactions, Ct (cycle threshold) values were obtained for each sample. The relative expression level was determined using the 2
−ΔΔCt
method [
57
]. The data were presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) based on three technical replicates of three biological replicates. Significant difference was determined at a
p
-value < 0.05.
5. Conclusions
The study emphasized the evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles of the
BnPERK
gene family. It suggested that
BnPERK
genes are involved in various physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and the defense against pathogens. The transcriptional downregulation of
BnPERK09A1
and
BnPERK09C1
upon
P. brassicae
infection and the potential involvement of these genes in clubroot disease response further emphasize their significance in plant immunity. The identification of
BnPERK09A1
and
BnPERK09C1
as potential targets for disease management strategies and their putative role in signaling networks could contribute to the resistance improvement of Brassicaceae crops.
