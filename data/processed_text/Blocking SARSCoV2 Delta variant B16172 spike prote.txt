Abstract
The emergence of
double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has
dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although
COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more
than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the
immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil
α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta
variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta
variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding
with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental
data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike
protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant
spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly.
Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer
quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the
modified Hill equation, we have determined
n
= 2.6
and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with
the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha,
beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the
binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those
for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human
ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability
for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions
into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding.
Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide-
and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one
type of peptide-attached GQDs.
1. Introduction
The
current global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million
death till now.

−

It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike
protein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates
the virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which
is the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.
5
−
9
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein became the target for COVID-19
vaccines available in the market, which can generate neutralizing
antibodies against the S-RBD upon immunization.
9
−
14
The emergence of double mutant delta (B.1.617.2) variants, which
contain the L452R and T478K mutations on the S-RBD, has enhanced the
binding affinity with ACE2.
1
−
6
Recent reports also indicate that mutations on the S-RBD lead to
a prominent decline in neutralizing antibody levels against the delta
variant by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination.
7
−
12
Due to the above fact, designing a new strategy to block the spike
protein–ACE interaction is very important for preventing mutate
variant infection.
Although the mortality rate is very high
for COVID-19, reported
data also indicates that around 42% of infected individuals are asymptomatic
carriers, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively controlled
by the human’s innate immune system.

−

α-Defensin human neutrophil peptides (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3, and
HNP4) and human β-defensins (HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3) as well as
LL-37 (leucine-leucine-37) cathelicidin family peptides are members
of the innate immune system.

Defensins and cathelicidin peptides play a crucial role in the human
body for viral inhibition via binding and destabilizing.

Driven by the need to block the delta variant infection,
herein we report the design of HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene
quantum dots (GQDs), which have the capability to bind to the SARS-CoV-2
delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD and block the S-RBD interaction
with ACE2, which prevents the virus entry into the host cells, as
shown in
Figure
1
.

protein RBD. (B) Scheme showing the blocking of the S-RBD interaction

Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) consisting
of a graphene lattice and
containing single or few sheets of graphene fragments exhibit size-dependent
luminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects
and edge effects.

GQDs containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy,
and hydroxyl exhibit a high water solubility, high surface area, excellent
photostability, and biocompatibility.
18
−
23
Due to their unique optical and other properties, GQDs became a
very good choice for use in bioimaging, biosensing, and other biotechnology
applications.

In our design, bioconjugated GQD fluorescence has been used to monitor
the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD–host
cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction to
determine the effective binding affinity. Also, the functional groups
on the surface and edge of GQDs have been used for the inactivation
of the virus via decomposition of the lipid membrane of the virus
and for the removal of spike proteins that are attached on the lipid
membrane.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Synthesis
and Characterization of HNP1 and
LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)
GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in
Scheme S1
in the Supporting Information. Initially,
graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite
powder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others
have reported before.
18
−
23
In the next step, GQDs were synthesized using a hydrothermal method
in the presence of dimethyl formamide (DMF).

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reported in
Figure S2A
in the Supporting Information shows
the two-dimensional (2D) morphology of the freshly prepared GO with
5 ± 2 μm size. On the other hand, the TEM image reported
in
Figure S2B
shows the zero-dimensional
(0D) morphology of the freshly prepared GQDs whose sizes are 4 ±
2 nm.
Table S1
shows the dynamic light
scattering (DLS) measurement data, which matches well with the TEM
data. As shown in
Figure
1
A, for the development of HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense
peptide-attached GQDs, we used carbodiimide coupling chemistry between
the carboxy group of graphene oxides and the amine group of peptides.
The FTIR data from peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in
Figure S2G
, shows the presence of the −OH
stretch, −CH stretch, −amide-I, −amide-II, and
−amide-III bands, which indicates that the peptides are attached
on the GQD surfaces. The DLS data indicates the ζ-potential
changes from −14 ± 2 mV to 3 ± 1 mV after peptide
binding, which also indicates that the peptides are on the surface
of GQDs. The TEM data reported in
Figure
2
A indicates that the size of peptide-conjugated
GQDs are 6 ± 2 nm, which matches very well with the DLS data
reported in
Table S1
. The inset in
Figure
2
A shows the high-resolution
TEM for peptide-conjugated GQDs, which shows the graphite structure
with a stripe distance of ∼0.24 nm.

Information shows the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which
indicates a broad peak at 26.5° due to the (002) reflection of
graphite.

the SARS-CoV-2 Delta
Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host
Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs Using Peptide-Attached GQD-Based Luminescence
For the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein RBD and HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached
GQDs, we used a binding buffer. The experimental details are reported
in the
Supporting Information
. For the
detection of luminescence from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached
GQDs, in the presence and absence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant
(B.1.617.2) spike protein RBD, we used a portable fluorescence spectrometer
developed by us with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.

2.3. ELISA-like Assay for Determining the Binding
between the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein and Peptide-Attached
GQDs
For this purpose, we used an ELISA-like assay using
His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins, which were adsorbed
to a 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. For comparison with fluorescence
assay data, we kept the concentrations of GQDs and spike proteins
the same for both the measurements. After that, the plate was blocked
using a blocking buffer and then different concentrations of peptide-attached
GQDs were incubated on the plate. In the next step, we used a streptavidin
protein that is covalently conjugated to a horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) enzyme to determine the binding.

We also used TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine)
for colorimetric assay detection.

Signal intensity was recorded using a plate reader.
After that, data were graphed in GraphPad Prism. From the binding
curve, we estimated the binding constants (

we used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of
ACE2 (HEK-293T).

Since delta variant SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, for
our experiment, we used a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged Baculovirus
pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein
(catalog number #C1123G).

we used HEK293T cells. Dilutions of test HNP1 and LL-37 human host
defense peptide-attached GQDs were made in DMEM.

The GFP-tagged
Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein stock was mixed with the HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense
peptide-attached GQDs at different concentrations and incubated for
1 h. The experimental details are reported in the Supporting Information.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Determining
the Photoluminescence Quantum
Yield and Lifetime from HNP1 and LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached
GQDs
The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human
host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in
Figure S2E
, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed
at ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π*
transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be
due to the n−π* transition.

23
Figure S2F
and
Figure
2
C show the luminescence spectra of peptide-attached
GQDs at 360 nm excitation, where the strong emission maximum at 416
nm can be due to the electron–hole recombination and quantum
size effect.
18
−
23
Figure
2
B shows that
peptide-attached GQDs exhibit a strong blue fluorescence under UV
light. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was determined to
be ∼0.28 for peptide-attached GQDs. The photoluminescence decay
profiles for peptide-attached GQDs are reported in
Figure
2
D, which fit very well with
the triple exponential function with τ
1
= 0.32 ns,
τ
2
= 2.2 ns, and τ
3
= 7.3 ns.
3.2. Determining the Biocompatibility and Cytotoxicity
To determine the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the LL-37
and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs, we used normal skin HaCaT cells, lung
cancer A549 cells, and human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high
expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T).
11
−
15
,
26
,
27
All cells were treated with 60 μg/mL GQDs + 4 μg/mL
LL-37 + 4 μg/mL HNP1 for 48 h.
11
−
15
,
26
,
27
As reported in
Figures S3A,B
in the Supporting
Information, after treatment with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs or only GQDs or only peptides, the cell viability was hardly
changed for all the cell lines. The reported experimental data clearly
indicate that the LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs do not exhibit
any detectable cytotoxicity after 48 h of treatment.
3.3. Determining the Binding Affinity between the
SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2) Spike Protein RBD and HNP1 and
LL-37 Human Host Defense Peptide-Attached GQDs
Next, we have
determined whether the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike
protein RBD can bind with HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached
GQDs, which is a very important parameter for the inhibition of virus
infection. The experimental details are reported in the
Supporting Information
. The luminescence signals
from GQDs in the presence and absence of the spike protein were recorded
with a laser excitation of 360 nm from a diode laser.
11
−
15
,
26
,
27
The reported photograph in
Figure
2
B also shows that the intense fluorescence from peptide-conjugated
GQDs decreases in the presence of the spike protein.
In the
case of peptide-attached GQDs, the graphene quantum dots can bind
with the spike protein via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,
and charge transfer interaction.
18
,
19
On the other
hand, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides can bind with the spike protein via
hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, and hydrophobic interaction.
11
,
12
,
15
The observed huge fluorescence
quenching clearly indicates the strong interaction between peptide-attached
GQDs and the spike protein. The reported fluorescence quenching can
be the result of the static quenching due to the formation of a nonfluorescent
complex in the ground state. On the other hand, the observed quenching
can be due to the dynamic quenching, which is based on the Förster
resonance energy transfer from the donor peptide-attached GQDs to
the acceptor spike protein. As reported in
Figure
2
D, the photoluminescence decay curve remains
almost the same in the presence or absence of the delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein, which indicates that the fluorescence lifetime (τ
1
= 0.30 ns, τ
2
= 2.2 ns, and τ
3
= 7.1 ns) in the presence of the spike protein is very similar
to the data in the absence of the protein. The experimental lifetime
data clearly indicates that the observed quenching is a static quenching
process.
Similarly, as reported in
Figure S1E
in the Supporting Information, the UV–vis absorption
maximum
from peptide-attached GQDs is ∼10 nm shifted to a higher wavelength
in the presence of the spike protein, which also indicates the formation
of a complex in the ground state between the peptide-attached GQDs
and spike protein. Often, the static quenching process can be described
by the Stern–Volmer equation

where
F

is the fluorescence intensity
from the peptide-conjugated
GQDs in the absence of the spike protein,

fluorescence intensity in the presence of the spike protein, and [spike]

K

is the
Stern–Volmer constant, which depends on quencher rate coefficients
(

of the GQDs’ excited state in the absence of spike. As shown
in
Figure
2
E, the plot
of log[
F

/
F
] versus log[spike
concentration, in nM] for HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs indicates
the nonlinear fluorescence quenching process, which may be due to
the multiple binding sites.
Since we have observed a nonlinear
Stern–Volmer quenching
profile, we have used the modified Hill equation

affinity, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant, by fitting
the curve with

As shown in
Figures
2
F,G, the luminescence signal from HNP1 human host defense
peptide-attached
GQDs decreases slowly as the concentration of the spike protein increases.
By fitting the curve using
eq
3
, we have determined the binding affinity as 120 ± 20
nM in this case, as reported in
Table
1
.
To verify our data with a well-documented assay,
we used the ELISA-like
assay using the His-tag delta variant SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein.
26
,
27
The experimental details are reported in the
Supporting Information
. As reported in
Figure
2
H, the plot shows the binding curve between
the peptide-conjugated GQDs and spike protein in an ELISA plate-based
assay. From the binding curve, we have estimated the binding affinity
as 9 ± 1 nm for the delta variant spike with LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated
GQDs, which matches very well with the fluorescence quenching data.
Similarly, we have estimated the binding affinity for the delta variant
spike with different peptide-conjugated GQDs, LL-37 and HNP1 peptides
and ACE2, as reported in
Table
1
.
From the experimental data, we can conclude that the
binding affinities
for the delta variant spike with LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs are comparable with that for ACE2-delta variant spike binding.
Also, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed
higher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides
(HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide
can be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike
protein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical
modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites
(LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502).
7
,
11
On the other hand, HNP1 can bind to the spike-RBD in six sites (LYS417,
ALA475, PHE486, ASN487, TYR489, and GLN493).
7
,
11
The
observed higher binding may be due to the multiple binding site interaction.
During the past three years of pandemic, several new viral lineages
such as alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P1), delta (B.1.617.2),
and omicron (B.1.1.529) variants had risen.

To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached
GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies,
we have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability
with peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in
Table
2
, our experimental data indicate that the
binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher
than those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD.

Blocking Using the B Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)
Virus
Next, to find out whether LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs can bind with delta variant SARS-CoV-2, we have performed an
experiment using Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant
(B.1.617.2) spike protein. As shown in
Figure
3
A, the luminescence intensity from peptide-attached
GQDs decreases abruptly in the presence of 1000 virus, which indicates
that LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs can bind with Baculovirus
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2.

As reported in
Figure
3
B,C, the TEM images indicate that peptide-conjugated GQDs
are bound on the virus. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide-
and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached
GQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the
virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine
whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability
to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking
the spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic
kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T). For this
experiment, we have used GFP-tagged Baculovirus pseudotyped with a
SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein (catalog number
#C1123G). The experimental details are reported in the
Supporting Information

As shown in
Figure
3
D, in the absence of peptide-attached GQDs, the pseudotyped delta
variant virus binds with ACE2 on HEK-293T cells. The observed green
fluorescence is due to the presence of GFP-tagged pseudotyped virus
particles on the surface of HEK-293T cells via binding with ACE2.
Figure
3
E shows the bright-field
image of HEK-293T cells, which indicates the presence of the pseudotyped
virus on the cell surface. As shown in
Figure
3
H, in the presence of LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs, the pseudotyped delta variant virus cannot bind with ACE2 on
HEK-293 T cells, and as a result, we have not observed any green fluorescence.
Since LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs have high binding affinity
with the delta variant spike protein, the data shown above indicates
that they can be used to completely block the binding between ACE2
and the spike protein. Due to the above fact, LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-attached
GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta
variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells. On the other hand,
as reported in
Figures
3
F,G, LL-37 peptide-attached GQDs and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs cannot
completely block the virus spike protein–ACE2 binding. As reported
in
Figure
4
B, the blocking
capability decreases from 100 to 8% when only GQDs have been used.
Also, the blocking ability correlates very nicely with the spike binding
affinity, as reported in
Table
1
.

peptide-conjugated GQDs. The experimental details are reported in

B shows the
% inhibition, which clearly shows that 100% inhibition was achieved
in the case of LL-37 (4 μg/mL) and HNP1 (4 μg/mL)-attached
GQDs (30 μg/mL). On the other hand, less than the 10% inhibition
was achieved when only GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used.
The
reported data in
Table
3
and
Figure
4
B also
indicate that 70% inhibition can be achieved when LL-37 (4 μg/mL)
peptide-attached GQDs (30 μg/mL) were used. Similarly, using
only the LL-37 (4 μg/mL) peptide, we have achieved 40% inhibition.
From the reported inhibition data, we can conclude that the inhibition
efficiencies for LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs are much higher than
only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptide or GQDs. To
understand better about the above experimental observation, we have
also performed TEM and SEM imaging experiments after LL-37 and HNP1-attached
GQDs are exposed to the virus for 12 h. The SEM image in
Figure
4
C and the TEM image
in
Figure
4
D clearly
show that LL-37 and HNP1-attached GQDs can destroy the lipid membrane
of Baculovirus pseudotyped with a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2)
spike protein. Due to the above fact, the delta variant virus collapses
and spike proteins that are attached on the lipid membrane are removed.
The above process helps to stop the spread of the delta variant virus.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37
peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus
entry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with
ACE2. We have demonstrated that peptide-attached GQD-based fluorescence
quenching can be used for determining the binding affinity of the
delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein. The reported experimental
data show that the effective binding affinity between the HNP1 and
LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs and delta variant spike protein is comparable
with the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity. Using the alpha,
beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, we have shown that the binding
affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for
other variants. Our experimental observation using the HEK293T-human
ACE2 cell line demonstrated that LL-37 and HNP1 peptide-conjugated
GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta
variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells and the inhibition
efficiency for two peptide-attached GQDs is much higher than those
for only one type of peptide-attached GQDs or only peptides or GQDs.
