Abstract
To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of
Arabidopsis
seedlings that are regulated early during heat stress. Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for
AtANN1
and its close homolog
AtANN2
were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing
AtANN1
showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in
ann1/ann2
double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca
2+
]
cyt
) is greatly impaired in the
ann1
mutant and almost undetectable in
ann1/ann2
double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
and in the response of
Arabidopsis
seedlings to heat stress.
Temperatures above the optimum are sensed as heat stress (HS)
1
by all living organisms. When exposed to high temperature, plants have sophisticated mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis and minimize cell damage. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) mediate gene expression changes leading to the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that confer thermotolerance to plants (
1
,
2
,
3
). In recent years, there has been considerable progress in identifying the signaling steps that enable plants to respond to heat stress at the molecular level. These include: activation of bZIP transcription factors by heat-induced proteolytic cleavage (
4
); inhibition of transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) (
5
); accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by RBOHD activation (
6
); and reduced H2A.Z occupancy in nucleosomes of heat-regulated genes, which would be expected to stimulate transcription of these genes (
7
).
Many reports also provide evidence that membrane-localized calcium channels can act as sensors for increased temperature in plant cells (
8
,
9
). The increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca
2+
]
cyt
) caused by calcium influx from the extracellular matrix is an early critical step in the HS signal transduction pathway (
10
). In responding to this calcium influx, calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin and calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are activated. Calmodulin binds to a calmodulin-binding protein kinase, which in turn, activates heat-regulated changes in gene expression by phosphorylating HSF (
11
,
12
,
13
). CDPKs, on the other hand, might regulate plant heat-shock responses by activating multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases (
14
).
Despite considerable progress in studying the mechanisms of heat-shock signal transduction, our understanding of the heat signal perception and early signaling transduction mechanism is still very limited. Therefore, identifying novel proteins that regulate early heat-shock responses should help decoding high-temperature sensing and responding mechanism
in planta
. Along with advances in genome sequencing, new proteomic technologies have now emerged as an important tool in studying signal transduction mechanisms (
15
). Compared with traditional genetic studies, which rely on phenotypes caused by altering gene activity, proteomics not only provides real-time monitoring of abundance changes of certain proteins during cell and tissue responses to stimuli, but also reveals their mechanisms of function and regulation, such as post-translational modifications and protein–protein interaction. In this study, we used the two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) technology to find microsome-associated proteins whose level changes rapidly after heat-shock, and identified a set of membrane proteins that change abundance in response to a five-minute heat treatment. Among these proteins was annexin 1 (AtANN1), and here we demonstrate that this protein plays a key role in plant heat-stress responses by mediating a heat-induced increase in [Ca

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Plant Materials and Heat Shock Treatment
Arabidopsis thaliana
seeds were surface sterilized using 75% (v/v) ethanol and sowed in glass plates containing 25 ml growth medium containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) salt, 1.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) agar. Plates were stratified at 4 °C in darkness for 3 days. Seedlings were allowed to grow at 22 °C under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) for 1 week. For heat shock treatment, the glass plates were wrapped with general kitchen plastic wrap and submerged in a water bath at the indicated temperature for different periods. The seedlings were returned to 22 °C under long-day to recover for 1 week before taking pictures for analysis. All the data showed in this study has been performed at least three times with similar results. Representative data from one repetition are shown in the figures.
2D-DIGE Protein Sample Preparation
Because we were interested in finding heat shock-regulated proteins whose level changed rapidly, we used a water bath for our heat shock proteomic studies to make sure all the seedlings were instantly subjected to similar temperature at same time. To prepare the seedlings for 2D-DIGE protein sample extraction,
Arabidopsis
seedlings were grown in liquid medium containing 1/2 MS salt and 1.5% (w/v) sucrose under long day at 22 °C for 1 week. To avoid a nutrient shock effect, half of the old medium was transferred into a new container and incubated at 37 °C in the water bath, whereas the other half of the medium was kept at 22 °C with the seedlings. When the temperature of the water bath medium reached 37 °C, half of the seedlings were transferred into the medium to initiate the heat shock treatment. After heat shock treatment for 5 min, seedlings were harvested by filtering through a nylon mesh, quick tap-dried with tissue paper and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microsomal proteins were extracted as described previously (
16
), and dissolved in DIGE buffer (7
m
urea, 2
m
thiourea, 4% CHAPS) at a concentration around 5–10 μg/μl.
2D-DIGE Procedure and Image Analysis
Protein for 2D-DIGE analysis was labeled with CyDye
TM
DIGE fluor minimal labeling kit (GE Healthcare). In brief, 10 μl microsomal protein from control or heat treated sample was mixed with 0.25 μl of Tris-HCl (1.5
m
, pH 8.8) and 0.5 μl of 100 n
m
Cy3 or Cy5, respectively, and incubated in darkness at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl 10 m
m
lysine and incubating with the protein on ice for 10 min. The Cy3- and Cy5- labeled pair of control and heat treated samples were combined, and to the mix was added 9 μl of 1
m
DTT, 4.5 μl of IPG buffer, pH 4–7. One hundred-micrograms of unlabeled protein each from control and heat-treated samples was then added to make the total protein amount in the mixture around 300 μg. The DIGE buffer was used to adjust the final volume to 450 μl for separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using 24 cm Immobiline Dry Strips, pH 4–7. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to (
16
). DIGE images were acquired using a Typhoon trio scanner (GE healthcare). At least six biological repeats were performed, and labeling of two pairs of biological repeat samples was swapped to avoid identifying proteins that are preferentially labeled by a specific CyDye. Spots that showed consistent heat shock regulated changes in at least five biological repeat samples were picked using a robotic spot picker (GE healthcare).
Protein In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Identification
Protein in-gel digestion was performed as described previously (
17
). Extracted peptides in 0.1% formic acid were separated using a 100 μm ×150 mm C18 reverse phase column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 350 nl/min, and eluted using a linear acetonitrile (ACN) gradient (0–45%) with 0.1% formic acid over 60 min using a nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into a LTQ-XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an uncoated 15 μm inner diameter spraying needle with 2.1 kV electrospray voltage at 220 °C. Peptides were analyzed in positive ion mode with m/z range between 400 and 2000. Charged peaks over 1000 counts were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID) with 35% normalized collision energy and activation Q value was set to 0.25. The dynamic exclusion activation time was set to 30 s to prevent same
m/z
ions from being selected after its acquisition. CID product ions were analyzed on the linear ion trap in centroid mode.
Complete LC-MS/MS peak lists were searched against database generated from
Arabidopsis
subset of the NCBInr database (date 12/12/2012, 257,035 entries searched), using the SEQUEST search algorithm, which is part of the BioWorks 3.3.1 data analysis software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide mass range was set to 400–5000 amu. The precursor ions' tolerance and fragment ions' tolerance were set to 2.00 amu and 1.00 amu, respectively. Enzymatic digestion was specified as trypsin, with a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was allowed as fixed modifications, and methionine oxidation were allowed as variable modification. Search result option filter was set as the following: Delta CN ≥ 0.1; Xcorr (±1, 2, 3) = 1.75, 2.5, 3.0; peptide probability≤0.01.
Isolation of Annexin T-DNA Mutants
T-DNA insertional mutant for
AtANN1
(SALK_132169, SAIK_414_C01, WiscDsLox477–480P11),
AtANN2
(SALK_054223) and
AtANN6
(SALK_112492) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (
http://www.arabidopsis.org
), and are all in Columbia (Col-0) background. The identified
ann1–2
mutant was used to cross with
ann2
mutant. F3 segregated
ann1–2
/
ann2
double homozygous mutant were used for heat stress tolerance analysis. The gene specific primers used for genotyping the mutants were: 5′-gcctgcttcagcttttgtatg-3′ (left) and 5′-aacgctaccgacacaacattc-3′ (right) for SALK_132169; 5′-tgctccttctgatgatgctg-3′ (left) and 5′-ccaataaagcatcacgctca-3′ (right) for SAIL_414_C01; 5′-tggactcttgatccaccaga-3′ (left) and 5′-gagcaacaagcatgtcctca-3′ (right) for SALK_054223; 5′-ggcgtctctcaaaattccag-3′ (left) and 5′-caccagaaagctctccgtct-3′ (right) for SALK_112492. The transcript abundance of
AtANN1
and
AtANN2
in wild type and mutant seedlings was determined by semi-quantitative Reverse transcription PCR using 5′-atggcgactcttaaggtttc-3′ (left) and 5′-agcatcatcttcaccgagaag-3′ (right) for
AtANN1
and gene specific genotyping primer set for SALK_054223 and SALK_112492.
Plasmid Construction and Transformation
Full-length CDS of
AtANN1
were amplified by PCR, cloned into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and subcloned into Gateway compatible binary vector pEarleyGate 100 by LR clonase (Invitrogen). The construct was introduced into
Agrobacterium tumefaciens
strain GV3101 by electroporation and transformed into
Arabidopsis
(Col-0 ecotype) by the floral dipping method. Transgenic plants were selected by spraying plants with 5 μg/ml Basta (Finale). All transgenic lines used in this study are single insertional homozygous T3 lines.
Expression Analysis of HSFs and HSPs by RT-PCR and Western Blot
Wild type and
ann1–2/ann2
double mutant seedlings were grown in the same glass plates containing 15 ml growth medium (1/2 MS salt, 1.5% sucrose, and 0.8% agar) for 1 week at 22 °C under long-day condition. For heat shock treatment, the plates were placed into a growth chamber with temperature set at 37 °C. Seedlings were harvested at different time intervals and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RT-PCR analysis of the expression level of various HSFs transcript, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using ExScript
TM
RT reagent kit (Takara) according to manufacturer's instruction. Primer pairs used for RT-PCR analysis were: 5′-atgatgaacccgtttctcccggaag-3′ and 5′-ggaggtggaagccaaactctcatcac-3′ for HSF A7A; 5′-atggaagaactgaaagtggaaat-3′ and 5′-aggttccgaaccaagaaaacccatt-3′ for HSF A2; 5′-atgacggctgtgacggcggcgcaaag-3′ and 5′-gttgcagactttgctgcttttccac-3′ for HSF B1; 5′-acagatttcgctaaagatttgctt-3′ and 5′-cgcttcttcttcttcttcaatctc-3′ for HSF B2A. For protein abundance analysis of HSPs, frozen tissues were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen, boiled with 2× SDS sampling buffer, loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with different antibodies specifically against various HSPs (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) and detected with SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescence System (Pierce).

S::Aequorin
were grown in 1/2 MS salt containing medium for 10 days under long day at 22 °C. Seedlings (n ≥ 15 per treatment) were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated in dark with a calcium-measurement buffer (0.1 m

coelenterazine-h) at 22 °C for 6 h. The seedlings were quick rinsed two times with the calcium-measurement buffer, 100 μl 22 °C (control) or 37 °C (heat shock) calcium measurement buffer was quickly added to each well, and the plate was loaded into a microplate luminometer (Centro LB 960, Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN) that is at room temperature (control) or has been prewarmed to 37 °C (heat shock). Aequorin luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 0.5 s every 30 s. After 45 counts, 100 μl reconstitution solution (2
m
CaCl
2
, 20% ethanol) was injected and luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 10 more cycles, 0.5 s each. Percentage reconstitution value was calculated by dividing the luminescence signal recorded at each time point by the highest reconstitution luminescence value recorded in each well, respectively, for wild type,
ann1
and
ann1/2
mutants. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37 °C by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22 °C.
Determination of Total Ca

in Plant Tissues
Fifty seven-day-old
Arabidopsis
seedlings grown in 1/2 MS medium supplied with 1% sucrose were grouped as one sample and oven dried at 65 °C overnight. After recording the dry weights, the dried plants were digested with 5 ml HNO3 at 100 °C for 4 h. The digested mixture was transferred to a volumetric flask, and diluted precisely to 100 ml with double distilled water. Total plant Ca
2+
concentration was determined with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotomer (Model AA-240Z, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
RESULTS
The Effect of HS Temperature and Duration on the Survival of Arabidopsis
Seedlings
Increased environmental temperature triggers heat-shock responses (HSR) in plants; however, if the temperature rises above a certain limit, or the duration of the high temperature is too long, plants will not be able to survive. To study the HS response of plant cells, the treatment used should be strong enough to stimulate the HSR, but at the same time mild enough not to kill the plant. In order to find a proper heat-shock treatment condition for our proteomic studies, plates containing one-week-old
Arabidopsis
seedlings were treated at a range of temperatures and treatment durations, and post-treatment survival rates were calculated after the seedlings recovered at 22 °C for 1 week. Treatment of
Arabidopsis
seedlings in a 42 °C water bath up to 10 min did not induce irreversible damage to seedlings, whereas treatment with a 42 °C water bath for 30 min killed almost all of the seedlings. In comparison, seedlings treated with a 37 °C water bath for 30 min survived (
Fig. 1
). As 37 °C has been previously shown to induce HSR (
9
,
11
,
12
), a 37 °C water bath was used as our treatment temperature during the following proteomic studies.

One-week-old
Arabidopsis
seedlings were heat shock treated at different temperatures for the indicated time period and allowed to recover at 22 °C for 7 days before taking pictures for comparison.
Identification of Microsomal Proteins Whose Level Changes Rapidly After Heat Shock
Heat shock stimulates a rapid increase of the [Ca
2+
]
cyt
. This increase can be seen as early as 1 min after heat treatment, and reaches the maximum around 5 mins (
11
). In order to study the early cellular responses stimulated by HS, we exposed one-week-old
Arabidopsis
seedlings to 37 °C for 5 mins and harvested them for 2D-DIGE analysis.
Protein samples from control and treated seedlings were analyzed in at least six biological-repeat experiments. In average, over 1500 protein spots were detected in each gel (
Fig. 2
A
). Examination of the DIGE images identified over 49 spots that showed consistent abundance changes induced by heat shock. Surprisingly, the abundance of most spots was increased by heat treatment, and only a few showed decreased levels. These spots of interest were picked, digested in gel by trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A total of 27 heat-shock-regulated protein spots, which represented 19 unique proteins, were successfully identified (
Table I
). Functional classification showed these proteins are involved in processes such as hormone biosynthesis, protein translation, calcium signaling, cellular metabolism, and protein folding (chaperone).

Annexin 1 is Essential for Plant Resistance to Heat-Shock Treatment
Of all the microsomal proteins identified in
Table I
, we chose to further study AtANN1 (
Fig. 2
B
), because of prior evidence showing that it could play a major role in mediating plant stress responses. Using polyclonal antibody raised specific against a 31 amino acid sequence from AtANN1 (amino acids 200–231) (
19
), we confirmed the 2D-DIGE result in which AtANN1 protein levels increased in the microsomal fraction after 5 mins of HS (
Fig. 2
C
). We then isolated Transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants of
AtANN1
gene to investigate if
AtANN1
plays a significant role in HS responses in
Arabidopsis
. We obtained three insertion mutants for
AtANN1
, and these alleles were named as
ann1–1
(SalK_132169),
ann1–2
(Sail_414_C01), and
ann1–3
(WiscDsLox477–480P11;
Fig. 3
A
). The T-DNA insertion sites in these alleles were located at the 5′ UTR of the
AtANN1
gene (
ann1–1
) or within different positions of its second and third exon (
ann1–2
and
ann1–3
), respectively (
Fig. 3
A
). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of these T-DNA mutants showed that the expression of
AtANN1
in
ann1–2
and
ann1–3
is not detectable, whereas the expression of
AtANN1

One-week-old seedlings were subjected to 45 °C water bath for 13 min, and then allowed to recover at 22 °C for another week before they were photographed and calculate their survival rate. Consistent with the expression of endogenous
AtANN1
level,
ann1–2

There are eight members of the
Arabidopsis
annexin gene family. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AtANN1, AtANN2, and AtANN6 are all closely related, with AtANN2 and AtANN6 having 75% identity at the amino acid level (
20
). There is expression and immunolocalization evidence suggesting that AtANN1 and AtANN2 have both distinct and overlapping functions in
Arabidopsis
(
21
,
22
). To investigate if other annexins also participate in plant HS responses, we isolated T-DNA insertion mutants for
AtANN2
and
AtANN6
and tested basal thermotolerance of the mutant seedlings (
Fig. 4
A
,

B
). The sensitivity of
ann2
mutants to heat-shock treatment is higher than wild type but lower than
ann1–2
mutants (
Fig. 4

). In contrast, knocking out the expression of
AtANN6
did not alter the sensitivity of the mutant to heat-shock treatment (
Fig. 4
C
). We then generated an
ann1–2/ann2
double mutant by crossing
ann2
with
ann1–2
, and found the
ann1–2/ann2
double mutant seedlings were more sensitive to heat stress treatment than the
ann1–2
single mutants. These results indicated
AtANN1
and

, but not

Heat Stress-Induced Expression of HSF and HSP is Impaired in ann1/2 Mutant
Heat stress-induced expression of HSFs and HSPs plays an important role in the acquisition of thermotolerance by plants. To investigate whether the susceptibility of annexin mutants to heat stress is related to the level of endogenous HSFs and HSPs, the heat-induced expression of different HSFs and HSPs were analyzed in seedlings of wild type and
ann1–2/ann2
double mutants. Under normal conditions, expression of HSFs is either not detected or at a similar level in both wild type and
ann1–2/ann2
double mutants. Thirty minutes of heat shock induces a dramatic increase of HSFs expression in wild-type seedlings. In comparison, the increase in expression of HSFs in
ann1–2/ann2
double mutants is much smaller (
Fig. 5
A
). Similar results were observed for the expression of HSPs. Before heat-shock treatment, the protein levels of the HSP70, HSP90, and HSP17.7 in
ann1–2/ann2
double mutants were similar to wild type. After heat shock at 37 °C for 3 h, the protein abundance of these three proteins in wild-type seedlings was significantly higher than in those of the
ann1–2/ann2
mutants (
Fig. 5
B
). The reduced expression of HSFs and HSPs in
ann1–2/ann2
mutants after heat treatment suggests annexin is required for the early changes in gene expression induced by heat shock.

Plants Overexpressing AtANN1 are more Resistant to Heat-Shock Treatment
To further confirm the function of annexin in plants' heat-shock response, we overexpressed
AtANN1
in
ann1–2
mutant background. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the expression level of
AtANN1
in two transgenic lines, OX-1 and OX-2, were both higher than in wild type. Seedlings overexpressing
AtANN1
were more resistant to heat-shock treatment than wild-type seedlings. The average survival rate of annexin-overexpressing seedlings was 20% higher than wild-type seedlings, and the difference is statistically significant (
Fig. 6
). This result demonstrates that the expression level of annexin is directly related to the basal thermotolerance of young
Arabidopsis
seedlings.

Suppressing the Expression of AtANN1 and AtANN2 Inhibits Heat-Shock-Induced Increase in Intracellular Calcium Levels
Prior reports indicated that AtANN1 could function to increase the Ca
2+
permeability of plasma membranes during plant stress responses (
23
,
24
). In order to test whether heat-induced calcium transport is altered in AtANN1 loss-of-function mutants, we crossed the
ann1–2
and
ann1–2/ann2
mutants with transgenic plants expressing
35
S::Aequorin
(
25
), F3 segregant lines that were homozygous for
35
S::Aequorin
/
ann1–2
and
35
S::Aequorin
/
ann1–2/ann2
mutants were chosen and used for monitoring heat shock stimulated changes in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
. RT-PCR showed the expression of
AtANN1
and
AtANN2
is not detectable in our
35
S::Aequorin
expressing
ann1–2/ann2
double knockout mutant (
Fig. 7
A
). Measurement of cytosolic calcium concentration showed the highest luminescence signal emitted by reconstituted aequorin is lower in
35
S::Aequorin
expressing
ann1–2
and
ann1–2/ann2
mutants (
Fig. 7
B
), which might be caused by the lower total calcium abundance in the seedlings (
Fig. 7
C
). Because there is a difference in the reconstituted luminescence signals observed between wild type and the mutants, we used percentage reconstitution values to determine the relative luminescence in response to heat-shock treatment for wild type and mutants seedlings. As shown in
Fig. 7
D
, in consistent with previous reports (
11
), heat-shock treatment induced a rapid increase in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
within 5 min in wild type,
ann1–2
, and
ann1–2/ann2
mutants. The heat induced [Ca
2+
]
cyt
continues to increase in wild type and reaches the highest peak around 12 min. In comparison, this prolonged increase in the heat induced [Ca
2+
]
cyt
was diminished in
ann1–2
mutant and absent in
ann1–2/ann2
double mutant (
Fig. 7

). These results suggest that AtANN1 and AtANN2 function is important for the normal heat-induced increase in [Ca

in
Arabidopsis
.

DISCUSSION
The heat-induced rapid increase in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
is considered to be an essential step in plant responses to heat stress. Prior reports showed this increase is regulated by plasma membrane-localized cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) (
8
,
9
) and phospholipase C9 (PLC9) (
26
), but there may be other calcium channels or membrane-localized proteins involved in regulating this rapid and dynamic change in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
in response to HS treatment. Because of prior studies showing that AtANN1 promoted the Ca
2+
permeability of plasma membranes, we selected it for further study from the microsomal proteins in
Arabidopsis
seedlings whose level changed rapidly after heat shock. We found that AtANN1 plays an important role in regulating heat-shock tolerance in
Arabidopsis
seedlings and that seedlings knocked out in their expression of
AtANN1
show impaired calcium influx in response to heat-shock treatment. These results suggest AtANN1 is a new component in regulating heat-shock-induced elevation of intracellular calcium concentration in plant cells.
Annexins bind membranes in a calcium-dependent manner. Although they appear to have diverse functions, it has become clear that certain annexins play important roles in abiotic stress responses (
20
,
27
). For example, ectopic expression of a
Brassica
annexin in
Arabidopsis
provides tolerance to drought, salinity and osmotic stress (
28
), and overexpression of
AtANN1
in
Arabidopsis
increases both drought tolerance in plants (
29
), and salinity tolerance in seeds (
30
). There are also previous studies linking annexins to heat-stress responses in plants. For example, a recent proteomic study analyzing heat stress in radish leaves found that the level of an annexin protein increased at 12 h, and then decreased at 24 h in response to 40 °C heat treatment (
31
). Chu
et al.
also identified an annexin protein from the embryonic axes of sacred lotus (
Nelumbo nucifera
Gaertn.) that was up-regulated by heat treatment. Ectopic expression of this lotus annexin in
Arabidopsis
conferred resistance to heat treatment in seed germination (
32
). In this study, we discovered that
Arabidopsis
AtANN1 is an early participant in a plant's response to heat treatment. The increase in abundance of AtANN1 in the microsomal membrane fraction can be observed after only 5 min of heat treatment. Among the eight annexins in the
Arabidopsis
genome, AtANN1 is the most abundant and appears to be a multifunctional protein (
33
). We found that knocking out the expression of either endogenous
AtANN1
or
AtANN2
makes mutants hypersensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas knocking out the expression
AtANN6
does not alter the sensitivity of the mutant, indicating
AtANN1
and
AtANN2
, but not
AtANN6
, are functionally redundant in regulating plant basal thermotolerance. Correspondingly,
Arabidopsis
seedlings overexpressing
AtANN1
were more resistant to heat stress. Furthermore, heat induced expression of HSFs and HSPs is attenuated in
ann1–2/ann2
double mutant. Taken together, these results suggest
AtANN1
and
AtANN2
are critical components of plants' adaptive responses to environmental heat stress.
There are numerous reports documenting AtANN1 functions as a calcium-permeable channel-like protein in response to abiotic stress, but most of the data was obtained from patch clamp experiments of spheroplasts and protoplasts of root epidermal cells (
23
,
24
,
34
). Here, using an aequorin reporting system, we found AtANN1 and AtANN2 play a role in regulating the elevation of [Ca
2+
]
cyt
induced by heat shock in whole seedlings. We found that heat-induced change in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
was greatly reduced in
ann1
mutant and was even lower in
ann1–2
/
ann2
double mutant, which suggests that AtANN1 and AtANN2 are important components of the channel transport system that regulates heat-induced increase in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
. However, heat shock still induces a small increase in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
in the
ann1–2/ann2
double mutant, especially in the first 5 min of heat shock treatment, which might be caused by the function of other proteins that facilitate Ca
2+
uptake, such as CNGCs in
Arabidopsis
. Interestingly, the total calcium concentration in
ann1
and
ann1/2
mutant seedlings is lower than wild-type control seedlings. However, future studies are needed to determine whether the reduced calcium accumulation is caused by the reduced calcium influx in
ann1
and
ann1/2
mutants.
In conclusion, we found that the abundance of AtANN1 protein in membranes increased rapidly in response to 5 min heat-shock treatment, and that AtANN1 is critical for plant heat-shock responses. Although it is still unresolved whether AtANN1 acts directly as a calcium-permeable channel
in vivo
or facilitates this calcium transport by some other mechanism (
35
,
36
,
37
), our results strongly suggest that in addition to previously characterized calcium-permeable channels, annexins are a significant component of the molecular machinery that promotes the heat-induced increase in [Ca
2+
]
cyt
. However, our data provide no evidence that AtANN1 functions as a heat sensor during plant heat-shock responses. Consequently, we propose that an elevated environmental temperature is first perceived by membrane sensors like CNGCs, which allows for an initial calcium influx into the cytosol. This increased [Ca
2+
]
cyt
would activate cytosolic AtANN1, recruiting it directly to membranes. The association of AtANN1 with membranes could then either form a calcium channel by itself or activate another calcium channel to allow more calcium influx into the cell needed to fully activate plant heat-shock responses.
