ABSTRACT
Nineteen strains from the order
Lactobacillales
were isolated from the International Space Station and commercial resupply vehicle, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. WGS would permit the characterization of these potentially pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the extreme conditions of the space environment.
ANNOUNCEMENT
The order
Lactobacillales
consists of Gram stain-positive, facultative anaerobes validly described by Ludwig et al. (
1
). Members of the genus
Enterococcus
are found to possess human pathogenicity characteristics such as antibiotic resistance (
2
) and therefore pose health concerns for those on Earth and astronauts residing in the International Space Station (ISS). However,
Aerococcus urinaeequi
, a nonpathogenic strain, was first isolated from horse urine (
3
). Astronauts on long flights are immunocompromised due to microgravity-induced physiological and mental stress. Decreased immune response allows bacteria to take growth advantage due to their adaptability potential in the space environment (
4
). Understanding the genomic makeup of these potential pathogens will help the development of suitable countermeasure and mitigation strategies. Members of the order
Lactobacillales
isolated from the ISS and the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) surfaces were
Enterococcus faecalis
,
Enterococcus faecium
, and
Aerococcus urinaeequi
(
5
,
6
).
E. faecalis
and
E. faecium
have been reported as nosocomial isolates harboring vancomycin and ampicillin resistance (
5
).
A. urinaeequi
was isolated from a chronic kidney disease patient and has also been reported to be resistant to vancomycin (
6
). Further characterization of the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these ISS environmental strains, including virulence genes, and subsequent confirmation in animal models are required to decipher their potential pathogenicity.
The strains used for the WGS were collected from three different ISS locations across two flights and seven different surface locations, including one field control on CRV6, and are detailed in
Table 1
(
7
). The samples collected from the ISS were brought back to Earth and aseptically processed, and suitable aliquots of the sample concentrate (100 μl) were plated onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) or Trypticase soy agar (TSA) medium and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. A single well-isolated colony on a culture plate was archived at −80°C. Genomic DNA was extracted from the overnight-grown cultures on TSA medium using a ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from the WGS, and BLAST analysis was conducted against type strains of all 16S rRNA sequences in the NCBI database. The bacterial species identity was determined when the queried sequence showed >97.5% similarity with the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strain. The WGS of the nearest neighbor was further selected for ANI evaluation: A,
A. urinaeequi

; C,

Hyphenated designations indicate the flight number followed by the location; for example, F1-1 indicates flight 1 and location 1.
The WGS of 19 bacterial isolates were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol for library preparation, as used in similar studies (
8
). The NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform was used to execute paired-end sequencing. FastQC v0.11.7 was used to validate the quality of the raw sequencing data (
9
). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were carried out using the software fastp v0.20.0 to perform quality control (
10
). The cleaned sequences were assembled using SPAdes v3.11.1 (
11
). The
N
50
values, numbers of contigs, and total genome lengths were generated using QUAST v5.0.2 and used to assess the quality of the final assembly (
12
). The average nucleotide identity was calculated by comparing all strains with their respective type strains, and their taxonomic affiliations, as well as genome statistics, are given in
Table 1
(
13
). The NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline v4.12 was used for genome annotation. Default parameters were used for all software.
