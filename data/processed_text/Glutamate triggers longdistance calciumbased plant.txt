Abstract
Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based
Arabidopsis
library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion.

Introduction
Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux
1
, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission

Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals from the site of perception to the distal tissues
5
. In response to herbivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind corresponding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials (SWPs)

Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effectively mediate neurotransmission in mammals
4
. However, in plant kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu) and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far defined as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic plant defense response

. In this study, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based
Arabidopsis
library
19
identified a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that highly accumulated Glu, the previously defined molecule crucial for activation of plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation of calcium-based defense signaling events.
Results
Identification of GSH as a signaling molecule that activates long-distance plant defense signaling events
During the genetic screening of the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based
Arabidopsis
library
19
,
20
for mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal pathogen
Botrytis cinerea
(
B. cinerea
), we identified a mutant, termed
hairpin RNA-52
(
hr-52
), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to
B. cinerea
infection (Supplementary Fig.
1
). A single gene
AT4G23100
was identified with PCR analysis on the mutant genomic DNA
19
,
20
.
To further verify that the decreased resistance in the
hr-52
mutant is caused by the interference with
AT4G23100
gene, we obtained the previously reported mutant
pad2-1
with the Ser298Asn substitution (S298N) within AT4G23100
21
to assess its responses to
B. cinerea
infection and insect attack. The results showed that
pad2-1
exhibited severe susceptibility to
B. cinerea
and
Spodoptera exigua
, a globally agricultural pest, while genetic transformation of
pad2-1
with
PAD2
(
AT4G23100
) completely restored the resistance (Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
). Our results together with the previous findings
21
–
23
demonstrate that
AT4G23100
gene is essential for plant defense response against
B. cinerea
infection and insect attack.
It was known that the
AT4G23100
gene encodes the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalyzing the reaction between Glu and cysteine for generation of glutamylcysteine in the GSH biosynthesis pathway
24
. We found that a high level of Glu (875.42 μg/g FW) was accumulated in the
pad2-1
mutant compared to WT (494.96 μg/g FW) while the GSH content in
pad2-1
(4.91 μg/g FW) was severely decreased to 5.9% of WT (82.94 μg/g FW) (Fig.
1a, b
). It is surprising that such a high level of Glu failed to induce plant defense in
pad2-1
(Supplementary Figs.
2
and
3
), which seems to be inconsistent with the previously defined role of Glu as a critical wound signal that activates plant defense response
11
. The observed susceptibility in the GSH-deficient
pad2-1
mutant suggests an indispensable role for GSH in plant defense, which encourages us to further investigate whether GSH acts as wound signal to trigger long distance calcium-based defense signaling events.

To verify the role of GSH in activating long-distance plant defense signaling events, we wounded leaf 1 of
pad2-1
and Col-0, and then measured the accumulation of wound-induced plant defensive hormonal molecules in leaf 6, considering that leaf n shares direct vascular connections with leaves n ± 5 and n ± 8 while leaves n ± 3 may represent contact parastichies formed by proximal but unconnected vasculature in adult
Arabidopsis
rosettes
7
,
25
. Consistent with the reduced plant resistance in
pad2-1
, the defensive phytohormone jasmonates were obviously decreased in the leaf 6 of
pad2-1
to ~63.04% (for JA) and ~45.81% (for JA-Ile) of those in Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig.
1c, d
). Moreover, the expression of JA-inducible defense marker genes
OPR3
,
JAZ5
, and
JAZ7
was also significantly attenuated in leaf 6 of
pad2-1
compared to Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig.
1e
). These results suggest that GSH might serve as a critical signaling molecule essential for activation of plant systemic defense signaling events.
To further explore the underlying mechanism of GSH in activating systemic plant defense responses, we introduced the [Ca
2+
]
cyt
reporter GCaMP3 into
pad2-1
, generating
GCaMP3
/
pad2-1
plant, to investigate whether the GSH-deficient mutant attenuated the wound-induced systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission. Upon mechanical wounding of leaf 1, both amplitude and kinetics of [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation in leaf 6 were reduced in
GCaMP3
/
pad2-1
compared with
GCaMP3
plants (Fig.
1f, g
; Supplementary Fig.
4
; Supplementary Movies
1
and
2
). The peak value of [Ca
2+
]
cyt
fluorescence changes in leaf 6 of
GCaMP3/pad2-1
was reduced to ~44.15% of that in
GCaMP3
(Fig.
1h
). Consistently, the percentage of each systemic leaf that showed apparent increased [Ca
2+
]
cyt
fluorescence was reduced in
GCaMP3/pad2-1
(Fig.
1i
). These data reinforce the role of GSH in triggering the wound-induced systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation in plants.
Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH might serve as an important wound signal that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses.
GSH triggers long-distance [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission
To further validate that GSH acts as a wound signal triggering long-distance plant defense signaling events, we applied GSH (with Glu and sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively) to leaf 1 of the
GCaMP3
plants and visualized the systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
in the whole seedlings (Fig.
2a, b
). Intriguingly, the fast and transient increase of [Ca
2+
]
cyt
was notably triggered in systemic leaves (including leaf 3, 4, and 6) by GSH (Supplementary Movie
3
) at the level comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig.
2a
). Specifically, [Ca
2+
]
cyt
rapidly increased to the peak value in leaf 6 at ~230 s upon treatment on leaf 1 with GSH rather than sorbitol (Fig.
2c
; Supplementary Fig.
4
), and more distal leaves showed [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation with the increased GSH concentrations (Supplementary Fig.
5
). Moreover, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with the Ca
2+
channel inhibitor LaCl
3
(Fig.
2e-g
). To exclude the possibility that GSH is cleaved by enzymes to release glutamate for Ca²⁺ signal propagation, we employed GGsTop, a well-known chemical inhibitor that specifically targets gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the enzyme responsible for converting GSH to Glu
26
. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in the Ca²⁺ signaling response when GSH was used in combination with GGsTop compared to that of GSH treatment alone (Supplementary Fig.
6
), suggesting that GSH was not converted to Glu for activation of systemic Ca
2+
signaling. Additionally, we synthesized another tripeptide (Glu-Pro-Ala), which contains glutamate along with two different amino acids, and investigated its effects in triggering systemic Ca
2+
signal propagation in plants. Unlike GSH treatment, application of Glu-Pro-Ala failed to induce long-distance transmission of Ca²⁺ signal in plants (Supplementary Fig.
7
), reinforcing the role of GSH as a signaling molecule that effectively triggers systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation in plants.

Consistently, GSH application on leaf 1 significantly induced the expression of defense-responsive genes (
OPR3
,
JAZ5
, and
JAZ10
) in leaf 6 (by ~5.6, ~8.6 and ~5.7 folds), which is comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig.
2d
). Moreover, pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with LaCl
3
severely reduced the GSH-inducible expression of defense genes in systemic leaves (Fig.
2h
), verifying that propagation of [Ca
2+
]
cyt
is required for GSH-induced defense gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GSH acts as an important wound signal in triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling.
GSH activates the transcriptional expression of defense-related genes in plant systemic leaves
To get deeper insights into the GSH-triggered systemic defense signaling events in plants, we performed transcriptome profiling on leaf 6 collected after 1  h application of GSH to leaf 1 of WT plants. We identified 378 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the systemic leaf of GSH-treated plants compared to non-stimulated mock control plants (Supplementary Data
1
). Among them, 354 genes including a large number of key defense-responsive genes were upregulated while 24 genes were downregulated (Fig.
3a
), which is well consistent with the tendency of transcriptome data from plants in response to wounding, namely, more transcripts are upregulated than downregulated
27
,
28
. Gene Ontology analysis (GO) of these DEGs further revealed significant enrichment of terms associated with plant defense signaling, including defense response, cellular responses to JA, response to wounding, and response to hormone (Fig.
3b
; Supplementary Data
2
). Consistent with the transcriptome analysis, qRT-PCR also showed that expression of defense marker genes (
CYP94C1
,
JAZ13
,
LOX4
,
OPR3
,
JAZ5
,
JAZ7
, and
JAZ10
) was highly induced in the systemic leaf tissues of GSH-treated plants (Fig.
3c, d
; Supplementary Fig.
8
). These data provide an overview of the GSH-induced gene expression in plant systemic leaf tissues and further indicate the important role of GSH in triggering plant long-distance defense signaling.

To further investigate the relations between GSH and Glu in plant wound response, we generated transcriptome data sets from leaf 6 1 h after wounding leaf 1 (Supplementary Data
3
) or application of Glu to leaf 1 (Supplementary Data
4
), and then compared these data to that induced by GSH. This comparison showed that 207 DEGs were co-regulated by wounding and GSH treatment, while 228 DEGs were found in both GSH and Glu treatment groups. Moreover, a total of 267 DEGs from GSH- and Glu-treated groups existed in wounding treatment, among which 126 genes were co-regulated by GSH, Glu and wounding, 81 genes were only regulated by GSH and wounding, and 60 genes were only regulated by Glu and wounding (Fig.
3e
). These overlapped genes which are co-regulated by GSH, Glu, and wounding or independently regulated by GSH and wounding, Glu and wounding are all mainly involved in plant defense signaling, including plant response to wounding, stress, JA, and biotic stimulus, regulation of cell communication, and innate immune response, suggesting that GSH and Glu are involved in wound-induced plant systemic defense response.
GLR3.3 is required for GSH-triggered systemic [Ca

]
cyt
propagation
GLR proteins which generally contain an amino-terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), have broad agonist profiles including glycine, cysteine, methionine, Glu and GSH
29
–
32
. Specially, Glu-triggered long-distance [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation is dramatically inhibited in
glr3.3glr3.6
mutant
11
. To figure out whether GSH-triggered long-distance calcium signaling depends on
GLR3.3
and
GLR3.6
, we compared the GSH-triggered Ca
2+
-related signaling events among the
glr3.3
,
glr3.6
and WT plants containing the GCaMP3 reporter (Fig.
4a, b
; Supplementary Fig.
9
). Interestingly, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission was severely reduced in the
GCaMP3/glr3.3
(Fig.
4a, b
; Supplementary Movie
4
). However, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission was not markedly attenuated in
GCaMP3/glr3.6
, which is similar to that of
GCaMP3
plant (Fig.
4a, b
; Supplementary Movie
5
). Consistently, the GSH-inducible expression of defense marker gene
OPR3
,
JAZ5
, and
JAZ10
was significantly repressed in the
GCaMP3/glr3.3
, but not obviously inhibited in the
GCaMP3/glr3.6
and the
GCaMP3
plants (Fig.
4c
). These results suggest that GLR3.3 plays a dominant role in regulating GSH-induced [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation. Similar to the systemic calcium signal transmission upon GSH treatment, Glu-induced [Ca
2+
]
cyt
propagation in systemic leaves were strongly inhibited in
GCaMP3/glr3.3
while remained unaffected in
GCaMP3/glr3.6
(Supplementary Fig.

To characterize the interaction between GLR3.3 and GSH, the predicted structure of GLR3.3 was used to perform molecular docking. The binding model showed that Glu binds to the LBD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3
LBD
) (Supplementary Fig.
11
), which is consistent with the recent report about the Glu binding to the GLR3.3
LBD
29
. While GSH was predicted to bind the ATD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3
ATD
), which is remarkably different from Glu in terms of binding domains and contacting amino acids (Supplementary Fig.
11
). Consistent with the predicted interaction between GLR3.3
ATD
and GSH (Supplementary Fig.
11
), recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data revealed that GSH binds the ATD of GLR3.4
30
, another
GLR
protein with high sequence similarity to GLR3.3, reinforcing that GSH might bind the ATD domain of GLR3.3 for activation of ion channel. Together with the genetic evidence showing GLR3.3 is required for both GSH- and Glu-triggered systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission (Fig.
4
; Supplementary Fig.
10
), these results collectively suggest that GSH and Glu may bind to different domains of GLR3.3 for activating ion channel activity and triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling.
Taken together, our results shown in Figs.
1
–
4
suggest that GSH serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance propagation of [Ca
2+
]
cyt
waves in a GLR3.3-dependent manner, thus inducing rapid JA biosynthesis in systemic leaf organs to protect plants from herbivory ahead of time.
Discussion
Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. Due to lack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to systemically deliver the wound signal from the site of injured organs to the distal undamaged tissues, which helps them be well-prepared for upcoming dangers
33
. In this study, we find that the GSH-deficient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated Glu previously defined as a critical wound signal essential for activating plant defense events, showed impaired plant defense signaling events (Fig.
1
; Supplementary Figs.
1
-
3
). We further define GSH as a critical wound signal that depends on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling in plants (Figs.
2
–
4
; Supplementary Figs.
5
-
11
). Intriguingly, in the animal nervous system, GSH has been identified as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter
34
–
36
, suggesting a potential conceptual parallel in GSH-mediated signal transmission across different kingdoms of life. Moreover, we noticed that GSH and Glu induced distinct [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission patterns in systemic leaves. Specifically, the spread of systemic [Ca
2+
]
cyt
triggered by GSH is preferentially initiated from marginal veins and rapidly transmitted to the mid veins (Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Movie
6
), whereas Glu mediated [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission mainly propagated from mid veins to marginal veins (Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Movie
7
). Re-examination of the data shown in the previous study revealing Glu as a wound signal also supports our observation that Glu triggers [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission with the direction of mid-to-marginal veins
11
. Intriguingly, the transmission pattern of wounding-induced [Ca
2+
]
cyt
contained both directions of the mid-to-marginal veins and the marginal-to-mid veins (Supplementary Fig.
12
and Supplementary Movie
8
). Future work to elucidate the mechanisms and biological significance of different [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission patterns induced by GSH and Glu would help us to further understand the highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against insect attack.
When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical wounding, they rapidly activate the JA signaling pathway in whole plant tissues, which in turn mediates the systemic defense responses against insects
10
–
12
,
37
. In our study, we defined GSH as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance [Ca
2+
]
cyt
transmission for activation of JA biosynthesis in distal organs, thereby inducing plant systemic defense response (Figs.
1
–
4
). Interestingly, as shown in our transcriptome data, in addition to the pronounced enrichment of genes associated with JA signaling in systemic leaf tissues after GSH treatment, genes responsive to other defense phytohormones such as ethylene and salicylic acid, which are responsible for plant resistance to pathogen infection, are also highly upregulated (Supplementary Data
1
), implying that GSH might also act as a signaling molecule to activate the plant systemic immune response. Previously recognized as an antioxidant, GSH is intricately linked with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling
38
. Our transcriptome analysis also revealed that genes responsive to oxidative stress were significantly induced in the systemic leaf tissues following GSH treatment (Supplementary Data
1
). Given that both calcium and ROS signals play a role in mediating plant systemic defense responses to wounding
11
,
12
,
39
–
41
, exploring the potential involvement of ROS in GSH-triggered systemic defense response would be interesting.
Wound-induced systemic defense signaling requires the involvement of GLR ion channel proteins, such as GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. Our study found that the GSH-triggered long-distance calcium-mediated defense response was suppressed in
GCaMP3/glr3.3
but nearly unaffected in
GCaMP3/glr3.6
(Fig.
4
). Similar to GSH, it was also observed that Glu depends on GLR3.3 rather than GLR3.6 to initiate the systemic calcium-based defense signaling (Supplementary Fig.
10
). Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, which revealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4 for ion channel activation
30
, it would be intriguing to investigate whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potential relationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore, in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identified Ricca’s factor TGGs, was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic defense response
6
. It would be exciting to further uncover the signal interactions among Glu, TGGs, and GSH in wound-induced systemic defense signaling. Given that various chemical substances have been identified as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in mammals, eliciting long-distance ionic responses that effectively mediate neurotransmission, identification of more systematic signaling molecules in the future would offer new insights into the complex systemic defense signaling in plants.
The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals (neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion fluxes are induced by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is dependent on electrical signals
1
,
2
,
42
. In contrast, little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distance signaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors such as Glu may rely on bulk flow and diffusion
14
. Given that GSH has a molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario is that when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, a large volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the apoplastic region, inducing calcium influx by activation of the GLR3.3 ion channel. With the action of diffusion and bulk flow of GSH within the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmitted between leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk flow theory, other theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphon model, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cell water shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolarization and water uptake
43
. More recently, osmotic pressure has been suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signaling molecules like Glu
15
. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca
2+
signal transmission would be fascinating.

Arabidopsis
seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach, sown on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After incubation in the dark at 4 °C for 2 days, plates were cultivated in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark (long day, LD) photoperiod. After 7 days, seedlings were then transplanted into soil and grown under the same condition. For insect feeding and pathogen inoculation assays, plants were grown in soil for 4–5 weeks at 22 °C with a 10 h/14 h light/dark (short day, SD) photoperiod. For real-time calcium imaging assay, plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 days in the dark and then transferred to 22 °C with a SD photoperiod for 6–7 days. Seedlings were then transferred onto new plates and grown for additional 14–16 days prior to use.
