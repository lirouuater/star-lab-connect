NUCLEAR ROCKET CERAMIC METAL FUEL FABRICATION USING TUNGSTEN  
POWDER COATING AND SPARK PLASMA SINTERING
1.  INTRODUCTION
 NASA ’s goal to conduct exploration missions beyond low-Earth orbit, including manned 
Mars missions, forces the nation to develop new enabling technologies. Nuclear thermal propulsion 
(NTP) is a technology innovation that has the potential to enable manned Mars missions. Nuclear 
thermal rockets (NTRs) utilize nuclear thermal energy to generate propulsive forces and offer  
a higher specific impulse than traditional chemically propelled spacecraft (liquid engines, solid 
motors, etc.), which reduces transient times and limits astronaut exposure to space radiation.  
A schematic of an NTR can be seen in figure 1.

 Efforts to develop NTRs have been ongoing intermittently since the 1960s; however, 
no manned-rated NTRs currently exist. Key to the development of an NTR is a robust nuclear 
fuel material that can perform in a harsh, high-temperature (>2,200 K) hydrogen environment.  
In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, two types of nuclear rocket fuel materials emerged from extensive 
research efforts––graphite-based fuels and ceramic metal (CERMET) fuels. The Rover/Nuclear 
Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NER V A) program successfully demonstrated the feasibility 
of NTRs by conducting a series of reactor development and nuclear engine system tests.1,2 Rover/
NER V A NTRs used nuclear fuel composed of a graphite matrix impregnated with uranium carbide; 
however, the graphite-based fuels employed in the Rover/NER V A engines suffered from fuel ero -
sion. An alternative fuel type that also received attention in the 1960s and 1970s was a refractory  
2metal-based fuel consisting of a tungsten (W) matrix with imbedded uranium dioxide (UO2) ceramic 
fuel particles. This fuel type is typically designated as a CERMET fuel. CERMET, for the purposes 
of this Technical Publication (TP), refers to W-UO2 fuels. The challenges that material scientists and 
engineers have faced while attempting to develop W-UO2 CERMET fuels have been documented 
and redocumented. This TP outlines a new technique to mitigate fabrication challenges using tung -
sten powder coating (WPC) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). WPC is a new process, developed 
internally at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for coating UO2 particles. SPS is an 
innovative powder consolidation technique. This research was conducted under a fiscal year 2016 
MSFC Center Innovation Fund (CIF) project with additional support from the NASA NTP project. 
 
32.  BACKGROUND
 The research conducted during this CIF project leverages both past research efforts from  
the 1960s and 1970s and more recent research conducted at MSFC around 2012–2015. This section 
summarizes the important aspects of past research and identifies its link to this CIF effort.   
2.1  Heritage Programs
 Over the last 50 years, scientists and engineers have explored many methods of CERMET 
fuel fabrication. Research into the fabrication of CERMET fuel (tungsten and depleted uranium 
dioxide (dUO2)) was undertaken by General Electric (GE), Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), 
and NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) in the 1960s and 1970s.3–5 Under the GE710 program, 
GE developed a process to consistently fabricate CERMET fuel elements by first cold pressing  
and then hydrogen sintering blended W-UO2 powders to form fuel wafers. Then, the wafers were 
stacked and subjected to hot isostatic pressing (HIP) to form elements. The GE710 process was 
instrumental in demonstrating the viability of CERMET fuels. Fuel elements fabricated during  
the program survived tens of thousands of hours of nonnuclear and in-pile testing.3,4 ANL  
CERMET fuels research focused on fabricating full-length fuel elements (45.7 cm) using a HIP process. 
Fuel elements created in this fashion commonly failed to meet dimension tolerances. LeRC explored 
multiple fabrication approaches including various forms of hot pressing, an extrusion technique, roll 
compaction, and cold pressing/sintering. Some of these methods showed potential; however, no fab -
rication technique reached full maturity under the program. While these heritage programs did not 
result in the release of a CERMET fuel specification or outline a proven process for fabrication, each 
program contributed to understanding the challenges (i.e., failure mechanisms, feedstock require -
ments, etc.) faced in CERMET fuel fabrication, paving the way for future research. A discussion  
of these challenges is presented in section 2.3 of this TP . 
2.2  Recent Research at Marshall Space Flight Center
 Under the Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (NCPS) project (2012–2015), MSFC engi -
neers and scientists labored to produce a 16-in CERMET fuel element. Research included successful 
HIP fabrication of surrogate CERMET fuel elements and attempts to develop a coating method 
for fuel particles. The need for coated fuel particles was established by past research efforts.6 Efforts 
under the NCPS project led to the development of an experimental chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 
system to deposit a protective tungsten coating on UO2 fuel particles prior to fuel element fabrica -
tion.7,8 The complexity of the CVD coating process forced MSFC researchers to explore alternative 
coating methods, which led to the development of WPC. WPC is a relatively simple process that uses 
a binder to adhere tungsten powder to the surface of UO2 particles. 
 MSFC’s research focused mainly upon a full-length HIP process as the sintering/consolida -
tion method because of the possibility of producing entire fuel elements in one sintering step. HIP 
4cans shown in figures 2 and 3 were fabricated and filled with a blend of W-dUO2. Filled cans were 
subjected to a HIP process to consolidate the powder within. 
Figure 2.  HIP can components.
Figure 3.  Filled HIP can.
5 Figure 4 shows a surrogate (does not contain dUO2) element post-HIP . Tungsten-dUO2 ele-
ments fabricated using this full-length HIP process suffer from low packing densities (less than 85% 
theoretical density (TD)) which lead to distortion of the fuel elements and fracturing of HIP cans.9 
Researchers realized the potential of beginning the fuel element fabrication process with a fully 
dense fuel wafer. Exploring a process to fabricate dense (greater than 85% of TD) wafers created  
an interest in SPS, a process that uses electric current and pressure to rapidly sinter powder into 
dense consolidated material. Limited research has been conducted to evaluate SPS fabrication of 
CERMET fuels. SPS fabrication using WPC UO2 fuel particles has never been researched.

2.3  Ceramic Metal Fabrication Challenges
 Challenges faced by MSFC researchers stem from the starting material or feedstock quality. 
A stable fuel material requires a high-quality feedstock. Requirements for quality feedstocks were 
specified by heritage programs.6 Namely, UO2 particles that are spherical, 10–100 μ in diameter,  
and contain low levels of impurities (less than 300 ppm) are required to produce fuel elements with 
suitable material properties. This CIF project used the highest quality feedstocks available; however, 
the material did not meet the specifications identified by heritage programs. (See section 4.1 for  
material specifications used for this research.) 
 The pursuit of appropriate feedstock material is ongoing. In addition to starting with  
an adequate feedstock material, heritage programs identified the need to coat fuel particles. The coat -
ing serves as a protective cladding that prohibits the hydrogen propellant from easily reacting with 
the UO2 particles. The coating also aids in the formation of a uniform microstructure which is key 
to the stability of the fuel. Fuel elements fabricated from low-quality feedstocks that are uncoated 
or poorly coated suffer from agglomeration and segregation which causes the fuel material to fail 
prematurely.
6 Figure 5 depicts agglomeration of particles based upon coating method and demonstrates 
how the microstructure improves with coating quality. For uncoated particles, the micrograph 
shows agglomeration, plenty of fuel particle-to-particle contact, and poor fuel particle distribution  
within the tungsten matrix. CVD-coated particles are uniformly distributed and do not suffer  
from agglomeration, while powder-coated particles exhibited less agglomeration and a more uni -
form distribution than uncoated particles. Figure 6 is a photo of a HIP can cross section depicting 
material that suffers from segregation. The majority of the dUO2 (darker colored material in this 
image) has migrated to the edges near the wall of the HIP can and the tungsten (lighter colored 
material) remained in the center. This material will not have the appropriate mechanical strength, 
which is provided by the tungsten matrix in W-UO2 CERMETs. The dUO2 around the edges will  
rapidly dissociate into free uranium and oxygen when exposed to hydrogen at elevated tem -
peratures, resulting in rapid fuel loss. The research conducted under this CIF project sought  
to fabricate high-density fuel material (greater than 90% of theoretical) and to improve fuel particle 
distribution within the tungsten matrix. Fuel material with these characteristics will mitigate UO2 
dissociation/instability in hydrogen due to the negative effects of agglomeration and segregation  
and will improve mechanical strength.

2.4  Mitigation Approach
 This research uses WPC and SPS to mitigate the challenges that were identified by pre -
vious research. WPC uses an organic binder that is mixed with the blended powders. During  
the mixing process, the binder pastes the smaller tungsten particles to the surface of the larger fuel 
particles coating the dUO2 particles with tungsten. Figures 7 and 8 are micrographs of WPC par -
ticles. Agglomeration and particle-to-particle contact is less likely to occur when particles are com -
pletely encapsulated with tungsten. SPS was used to address distortion and low density issues that 
occurred during the full-length HIP process explored under the NCPS project. As mentioned in 
section 2.2, SPS is a sintering technique that uses pulsed electrical current to consolidate powders  
into solid material. Powder material is loaded into a graphite die. Current is passed through the die and  
the material, while a mechanical ram applies an axial load to the material. The current causes Joule 
heating which elevates the temperature to the material’s sintering temperature. Sintering occurs  
when a material at an elevated temperature in powder form becomes soft and coalesces at a molecu -
lar level. The post-sintered material is a solid mass instead of a blend of loose powders. SPS is 
a rapid process that sinters powdered materials in minutes instead of the hours or days that are  
required for conventional hydrogen/furnace sintering techniques that were employed during the  
GE710 program.
83.  OBJECTIVES
 This project sought to evaluate the feasibility of WPC and SPS to produce a robust nuclear 
fuel material. The primary goal is to further the development of CERMET fuels by demonstrating 
a viable method to produce fuel material, which is fundamental to the production of a prototypic 
fuel element for NTR applications. WPC provides the protective tungsten coating, and SPS is used  
to consolidate the blended powder (W-dUO2) material. The fabrication process for this research 
builds on the GE710 process by beginning with dense wafers or compacts that could be stacked  
to form fuel elements. WPC simplifies the fuel particle coating process, and SPS allows for the 
rapid sintering of blended fuel material into highly dense wafers. Future research, which is beyond  
the scope of this TP, will seek to develop a process for fabricating fuel elements of specific geometries 
and detail from dense wafers. 
 The density and microstructure of the sintered wafers were evaluated to provide data to pre -
dict the material performance capability. Microstructure (i.e., fuel particle agglomeration, segrega -
tion, and distribution within the tungsten matrix) and density are important characteristics needed  
to assess material performance. Stable fuel material requires fuel particles that are uniformly dis -
persed within the tungsten metal matrix displaying little or no contact between fuel particles. Fur -
thermore, fuel material shall be dense without excess pores or voids within the tungsten matrix, 
which reduces the mechanical strength of the fuel material. Experiments were developed to evaluate 
these requirements for fuel material fabricated via SPS using WPC dUO2 feedstock material. 
94.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
4.1  Material
 For this research, tungsten was purchased from H.C. Starck. Particles sizes ranged from 9 to 
13 μ with a 0.1 ppm maximum iron, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. The depleted UO2 particles were 
supplied by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Particles were greater than 150 μ. Depleted uranium 
dioxide and tungsten were blended to yield a W-60 vol% dUO2 mixture. The heritage mixture ratio 
60 vol% dUO2 is routinely employed when conducting CERMET research.  
4.2  Tungsten Powder Coating Process
 Quantities of W-dUO2 were weighed and blended in 100-g batches. This batch size was 
driven by the WPC process. Each 100-g batch contained approximately 54 g of tungsten and 46 g  
of dUO2. A small quantity of an organic binder material was added to each batch. Then, each batch 
was blended in a Turbula® shaker-mixer for approximately 1 hour. The blended material was further 
processed to ensure that the smaller tungsten particles were bounded to the surface of the larger 
dUO2 particles. A micrograph of tungsten powder-coated material can be seen in figure 7. The two 
figures show smaller tungsten particles affixed to the surfaces of much larger particles.

4.3  Spark Plasma Sintering Process
 Approximately 31 g of blended W-60 vol% dUO2 material were loaded into a 20-mm graphite 
die and sandwiched between two graphite punches. Thirty-one grams were chosen to produce post-
sinter specimens that were approximately 6 mm thick, which made convenient rough density calcula -
tions possible prior to making more precise density measurements. This graphite die/punch assembly 
10was loaded into the SPS system. Sintering was accomplished by increasing the temperature at a rate 
of 100 °C per minute and pressure at a rate of 20 MPa per minute until the material reached the pre -
determined sintering temperature and pressure (sintering pressure = 50 MPa for all specimens). The 
sintering temperature and pressure were maintained for 20 minute; then, the material was cooled at 
a rate of 20 °C per minute. The sintering temperature was varied as shown in table 1. Each specimen 
was given a unique identification number as shown in figure 8.

5.1.1  Theoretical Density
 As previously stated, TD is the maximum achievable density value that would be obtained if 
the specimen’s particles were perfectly arranged and consolidated with no porosity. Though TD is 
most optimal, it is rarely obtained; therefore, the specimen’s measured density values are typically 
compared to the TD as an indication of sintering efficiency. For example, a specimen with a TD  
of 20 g/cc and a measured density of 19.5 g/cc has a density that is approximately 98% theoretical. 
The rule of mixtures was used to determine the TD of the W-60 vol% dUO2 mixture:
 ρ = M / V  . (1)
The density of a mixture is as follows:
 ρmix = (MA + MB) / VT  , (2)
where
 ρmix  = density of the mixture
 MA = mass of component A
 MB  = mass of component B
 VT  = total volume.
13The rule of mixtures is derived as follows:
Rearranging equation (1) yields: 
 M = V * ρ  . (3)
Substituting equation (3) into equation (2) yields equation (4):
 ρmix = (VA * ρA) + (VB * ρB) / VT   . (4)
 Using the relationship that the volume of component A ( VA) divided by VT is the volume 
fraction of component A ( vA) and the volume of component B ( VB) divided by VT is the volume 
fraction of component B ( vB) yields equation (5), the rule of mixtures:
 ρ mix = vA * ρA + vB * ρA  . (5)
 Figure 11 shows how the rule of mixtures was used to calculate the TD for the W-dUO2 
specimens. The TD is equal to 14.282 g/cm3. The tungsten density is ρW.10 The density of dUO2 is 
ρdUO2.11 Vol%dUO2 is the volume percentage of dUO2 in the mixture, and the ρTD is W-60 vol% 
of the dUO2 mixture.
 W = 19.25 gm/cm3  dUO2 = 10.97 gm/cm3vol%dUO2 = 60%
 TD = (1 – vol%dUO2) •    W + vol%dUO2 •    dUO2 = 14.282 gm/cm3

5.2  Microstructure
 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the microstructure of multiple 
specimens. Micrographs were obtained from a JEOL JSM-6610LV SEM. Specimens were mounted 
in epoxy. Some specimens were sectioned prior to mounting to expose the subsurface microstructure. 
Specimen preparation for SEM included grinding and polishing to produce a smooth contamination-
free surface. Both secondary electron and backscatter images were obtained. Elemental analysis was 
performed via energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) using an EDAX silicon drift detector.
14 The dispersion of dUO2 within the tungsten matrix can be seen in figures 12 and 13 for NASA-
SPS-1800C-005 and NASA-SPS-1750C-004. The majority of the fuel particles are surrounded  
by tungsten providing minimal particle interconnectivity. The tungsten metal matrix is completely 
sintered with minimal pores or voids. The fuel particles are spherical and nearly monodisperse.

 A cross section of NASA-SPS-1800C-005 can be seen in figure 14. The cross section reveals 
some particle elongation which is likely due to axial loading during the SPS process. Evidence of 
particle pullout was also observed in some micrographs. Pullout can be accredited to specimen 
preparation (grinding).

 EDS analysis (fig. 15) provides a very distinctive image of the material’s microstructure. 
Smaller flakes of imbedded dUO2 can be seen within the tungsten matrix. The flakes were likely 
formed during the initial Turbula® blending process.

166.  CONCLUSIONS
 All technical objectives were achieved. SPS and WPC can potentially be employed to produce 
W-dUO2 CERMET fuel wafers that are dense and that have a desirable microstructure. Density val -
ues for fuel wafers that were fabricated using the method described herein measured above 95% of 
the TD. Density values in this range coincide with wafers with little to no voids as was revealed by 
the included microscopy and elemental analysis. The microstructure was uniformly dispersed with 
tungsten metal surrounding most of the fuel particles. 
 More research is needed to fully assess this material. A study of the interface between dUO2 
particles and the tungsten matrix is forthcoming and will be included in future research. Future 
research will also include hot hydrogen testing to assess material properties and performance. Fur -
thermore, a measure of the material hardness would provide more insight into the mechanical prop -
erties of the material. Research to study the microstructural effects of fuel particle size and fuel 
loading would also be insightful.
 The ultimate goal is to develop a repeatable process for producing a robust CERMET fuel 
element that can be used for NTR applications, however, much research is needed to achieve that 
goal. Fuel elements for current NTR design concepts range in length from 40 to 70 cm or more. An 
NTR could require in excess of 100 elements per reactor core. While SPS provides a method to rap -
idly produce fuel wafers of varying geometries (heritage NTR fuel elements are typically hexagonally 
shaped), an SPS system capable of producing longer fuel wafers would likely be required. A process 
could be developed using GE’s 710 approach (GE710) of stacking SPS wafers and then hot isostatic 
press-bonding the wafers to form the full length element. Possibly, a custom SPS system capable of 
producing a 20-cm-long wafer could be produced. Custom dies for producing hexagonal SPS fuel 
wafers have already been the subject of other research projects.9 Future research is needed to address 
these and other issues that are beyond the scope of this TP .

U U UNuclear thermal propulsion is an enabling technology for crewed Mars missions. An investigation was conducted 
to evaluate spark plasma sintering (SPS) as a method to produce tungsten-depleted uranium dioxide (W-dUO2) 
fuel material when employing fuel particles that were tungsten powder coated. Ceramic metal fuel wafers were pro -
duced from a blend of W-60vol% dUO2 powder that was sintered via SPS. The maximum sintering temperatures 
were varied from 1,600 to 1,850 °C while applying a 50-MPa axial load. Wafers exhibited high density (>95% of 
theoretical) and a uniform microstructure (fuel particles uniformly dispersed throughout tungsten matrix).
